Stars Morris Chestnut and <span data-scayt_word=Jaina data-scaytid=1>Jaina</span> Lee Ortiz announced that the series would not be coming back on their social media accounts early Tuesday.</p><p>“I am very grateful about the part that everyone took in Rosewood‘s journey, because everyone was truly an integral part; the writers who crafted great story-lines, the actors who brought these stories to life, the production crew who sustained the show’s infrastructure, and the terrific fans who embraced this phenomenon and became just as much a part of Rosewood as anyone else,” Chestnut <a href=# rel=nofollow>wrote</a> in a lengthy post. “Fox provided a platform for a show that made strides in diversity and the images it projected, as all-inclusive. We were able to peer into the lives of characters who displayed their hopes, dreams, courage and fears. Rosewood also helped reinforce a newer definition of Family, as a group of people who most care for and support one another. The Rosewood family, itself was an Extremely Special group of people who’ll be friends forever.”</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p>Ortiz also penned a heartfelt note on&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow><span data-scayt_word=Instagram data-scaytid=3>Instagram</span></a>: “Today is a special day. Today I say goodbye to my very first show, Rosewood. I say goodbye to Detective <span data-scayt_word=Annalise data-scaytid=4>Annalise</span> Villa. Damn, I’m <span data-scayt_word=gonna data-scaytid=5>gonna</span> miss that woman. To my partner in crime/the guy who mentored me and showed me the ropes on set. The beautiful Morris Chestnut, and when I say beautiful, I mean his HEART, his SOUL. He is the most selfless person I think I’ve ever met. Kind and gracious. Our rock. Our captain. 5 days a week, 14 hours a day, he became one of my best-friends. Love you, <span data-scayt_word=Morrisito data-scaytid=6>Morrisito</span>. The cast…you’re my family. To all the hardworking crew and writers…you showed me what “movie magic” was really made out of. It’s created on the backs of your hard work. Last but not least, this show and it’s incredible characters were created by Todd <span data-scayt_word=Harthan data-scaytid=7>Harthan</span>. This guy said yes when everyone else told me no, and it has changed my life forever. I adore you.”</p><p>The medial procedural, produced in-house at <span data-scayt_word=20th data-scaytid=13>20th</span> Century Fox Television, was down considerably in its sophomore outing after being moved from Empire’s lead-in Wednesdays to open Thursdays. Season two averaged 4.4 million total viewers and a 1.0 in the demo. The show was later moved from Thursdays to Fridays midway through season two, which wrapped in April. The cancelation comes despite the show’s ranking as the network’s least expensive drama.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p>Rosewood follows the rookie baseball drama <a href=# rel=noopener>Pitch</a>, which was canceled after one season.&nbsp;</p><p>Keep track of all the broadcast renewals, cancelations and series pickups with&nbsp;<a href=#><span data-scayt_word="THR's" data-scaytid=16><span data-scayt_word="THR's" data-scaytid=24>THR</span>‘s</span></a><a href=#>&nbsp;handy scorecard</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOq6asnaekvKV5wpqlnJ2cmrFurdNmnaiwXWd6tLHArKanq11mfXF9lW5oaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
