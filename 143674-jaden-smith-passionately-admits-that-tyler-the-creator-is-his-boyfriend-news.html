From spectacular performances to unexpected proclamations, there were plenty of newsworthy moments. With&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Kids See Ghosts' performance</a> keeping everybody entertained until the end of the night and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Tyler, The Creator</a> constantly popping up in the crowd, many had their eyes on the streams for the event. One thing that <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Jaden Smith</a> said during his show surprised people though. He's certainly close to Brockhampton leadman <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Kevin Abstract</a> and he's shown love to Tyler in the past but nobody expected this out of Will Smith's son.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Jaden has always been pretty sexually ambiguous. You'll remember he rocked a skirt for his Louis Vuitton campaign. Tyler has also rapped in the past about "kissing white boys since 2004." Obviously, neither is afraid of the outdated negative perception attached to homosexuality in hip-hop. During his performance last night, Jaden told the crowd that if there's one thing he wants them to take away from his set, it's that he and Tyler are "boyfriends." The carnival, put on by Tyler, presented an opportunity for many performers to show love to the Odd <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Future</a> frontman. After Smith called him his "best friend" in the world, he revealed that Tyler was against him revealing that the two were a couple. At this point, it's unclear whether the two are trolling us all or if they're serious. Jaden is still going with it on his social media profiles, though.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdhaYB3g5NmoZqclaN6tLnIrZ9mqJGowKq7zZqrnqSpYq6lucitqmasmJbBbsDYpZyrZaSdsm6v0Z6YraeiYra0eceiqmaan66zs7XEp5tmppWswA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
