No, honestly it is! Whether you're preparing to jet away for a family holiday, a trip with friends or a romantic break with your other half, we've done the hard part for you by compiling your need-to-know packing guide - so now there's just the small matter of how to fit it all into your suitcase!</p><h2>My top 5 travel essentials</h2><li><span><a class=hm-link href=# rel="sponsored noopenernofollow nofollow">Packing cubes</a></span></li><li><a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopenernofollow nofollow">Travel adaptor</a></li><li><span><a class=hm-link href=# rel="sponsored noopenernofollow nofollow">Plane activity for kids</a></span></li><li><span><a class=hm-link href=# rel="sponsored noopenernofollow nofollow">Ear plugs</a></span></li><li><span><a class=hm-link href=# rel="sponsored noopenernofollow nofollow">First Aid Kit</a></span></li><p id=eo68EE9pn2V data-wc=1>SQUIRREL_ANCHOR_LIST</p><p id=eNupmgtTQJD data-wc=98>Before I reveal the genius travel essentials I've found, I reached out to Gemma Rose Breger and Samantha Silver from <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopenernofollow nofollow">This Is Mothership</a>, who gave me their top tips for packing. "<a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>Packing cubes</a> are life," the duo declared. "They make it super easy to pack and unpack by compartmentalising your suitcase so you know exactly where everything is. You can pack in outfits or in sections eg: swimsuits, underwear. Also when it comes time to do the dreaded 'after holiday' laundry - use one for dirty, whites and one for clean - it saves huge amounts of time."</p><p id=ehzYgHqVRX data-wc=81>The pair, who have just released their first book, <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopenernofollow nofollow">This Is Beauty. This Is Fashion. This Is Life</a>, also recommend the roll don't fold approach to packing. "This technique takes up less room in the case, so you can pack more in, and causes less creasing," they tell us. Their final tip? "Stuff your hats with your pants. This pro-stylist trick helps to hold the shape of the hat, and can be space-saving, packing into crevices you may otherwise not use."</p><h2>How we chose the best items to pack for a holiday</h2><p id=erBXbbEBBF data-wc=56>Personal experience! I've just come back from a holiday, and I stupidly forgot some key things. I want to give you a list that I wish I had. I also reached out to the <strong>HELLO!</strong> Shopping Team for their suggestions as well. Most of these items will be from Amazon because often you need next-day delivery.&nbsp;</p><h2>The essentials to pack for your trip</h2><p id=evLzvgTV2R data-wc=51><strong>Travel documents</strong> are a given. These are the items you can't afford to travel without. Make sure you have your <strong>passport and various travel documents</strong> - such as your <strong>travel insurance</strong> - safe in your hand luggage. It’s also worth making a copy before you travel in case anything goes missing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/571c48fc418f-travel-photo.jpg><p id=ejhoYVNsmS data-wc=122>Use your hand luggage to store your valuables. From the all-important<strong>&nbsp;phone and charger&nbsp;</strong>to your <strong>travel currency</strong> and <strong>camera</strong>, you're going to want to save plenty of room in your hand luggage for these valuables and entertainment. Make sure you take an <strong>appropriate plug adaptor</strong> for your destination (I forgot this one for my most recent trip - doh!), and download some of your favourite films or TV shows to your iPad or tablet to watch on the flight if you have a long journey. Picking up a<strong>&nbsp;phrase book or travel guide</strong> to the country you're visiting will prove invaluable in helping you to find your way around and impress the locals with your lingo – or at least try.</p><p id=e8MusnEbvG data-wc=41>If you're travelling with children, keep little ones comfortable and entertained on your travels with <strong>snacks, toys and games</strong>. Don't forget a <strong>spare change of clothes for the journey</strong>, as well as any <strong>nappies</strong>, <strong>wet wipes</strong> and <strong>medication</strong> you may need.</p><p id=e7TmzcqYMp data-wc=60>In your suitcase, be sure to pack <strong>beachwear</strong>, <strong>swimwear</strong> and lots of <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>sun cream</a> if you're going somewhere hot. Make sure you take enough sun cream and<strong>&nbsp;after sun&nbsp;</strong>to see you through at least the first few days, and pack <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>bug repellent,</a> <strong>antiseptic cream</strong> and a <strong>first aid kit</strong> to keep your family happy and healthy throughout your trip.</p><p data-wc=50 id=e4x-AbUkZx9>While you can pick up many <strong>toiletries</strong> and emergency supplies close to most resorts, taking your own will give you peace of mind that you have everything you need on hand, while saving valuable time to enjoy by the pool or on the beach.<a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>&nbsp;Travel size mini products</a> are good!&nbsp;</p><p data-wc=39 id=e2qcswNPp-H>Fingers crossed everything will be perfect on your trip, but it’s important to prepare for all eventualities – from packing an <strong>umbrella</strong> or <strong>waterproof jacket&nbsp;</strong>for any sudden downpours to taking a s<strong>mall sewing kit&nbsp;</strong>for any clothing malfunctions.</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!

To put a stop to luggage panic, we’re big fans of adding Apple’s AirTag tracker to our suitcases, which uses Apple’s 'Find My' network and Precision Finding technology to show you exactly where your items are at any given time.</p><p>On my most recent holiday to the Maldives, I was so worried my luggage wouldn't make the connection. As soon as I checked and discovered it was on track, I could sit and enjoy my flight in peace.</p><h2 class="AffiliateProductArticleTitle_a1wx4xtc hm-heading">Meowoo 9Pcs Packing Cubes for Suitcases</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e7017d24fe56-packing-cubes.jpg><p class=AffiliateProductArticleProsConsTitle_a1osl6fn></p><p>Packing cubes are a really good idea. If you're going away for a few days, use the packing cubes for day one, day two and day three's outfits including underwear and accessories. That way, you won't even need to rummage around to find something. If you're going away for longer, you could use packing cubes for swimwear and underwear and they're especially good when packing for the kids.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="AffiliateProductArticleTitle_a1wx4xtc hm-heading">European Plug Adapter with 3 USB</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0203f3d1bb5d-european-travel-adaptor.jpg><p class=AffiliateProductArticleProsConsTitle_a1osl6fn></p><p>We've all been there - you forget the travel adaptor and have to spend three times as much on one at the airport. Don't let this happen. I forgot mine on my most recent trip, but I'll definitely be looking into buying this one as I like that there are added usb plugs on there.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="AffiliateProductArticleTitle_a1wx4xtc hm-heading">Electronics Organiser</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/6927cb99318f-electronics-organiser.jpg><p class=AffiliateProductArticleProsConsTitle_a1osl6fn></p><p>I admit, this is a bit niche. But it'll come in handy whether you're on holiday or not. If you love your tech, this little tech organiser can be super helpful. Store away your camera cables, your phone cables, Kindle charger, and whatever else you need.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="AffiliateProductArticleTitle_a1wx4xtc hm-heading">LogHog Portable Leather Soft & Semi Hard Sunglasses Case</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/42d6b8e99c6f-sunglasses-holder.jpg><p class=AffiliateProductArticleProsConsTitle_a1osl6fn></p><p>I have one of these and it comes with me on every holiday.

So I'm calling them as a success, and they are in a beautiful range of stylish colours for the fashion conscious mosquito meal."</p><h2 class="AffiliateProductArticleTitle_a1wx4xtc hm-heading">Lonely Planet Kids Create Your Own Travel Journal</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a21c8cd90bf9-travel-journal.jpg><p class=AffiliateProductArticleProsConsTitle_a1osl6fn></p><p>Make your vacation memories last a lifetime with this awesome fill-in children’s travel journal that’s packed with brilliant activities and prompts to inspire kids to write and draw their adventures.&nbsp;</p><p>Draw your own passport picture; make a cool flip-book animation of your experiences; describe the tastiest treat from your journey.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="AffiliateProductArticleTitle_a1wx4xtc hm-heading">Universal Waterproof Phone Pouch Bag</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7c63f667ef7a-phone-pouches.jpg><p class=AffiliateProductArticleProsConsTitle_a1osl6fn></p><p>When I went to the Maldives, I was so jealous of everyone I spotted with one of these clear phone pouches.
