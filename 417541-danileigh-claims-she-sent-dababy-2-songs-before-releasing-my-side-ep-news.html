Weeks ago, the Def Jam singer shared<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color"> her My Side EP </a>that pretty much chronicled her relationship fallout with DaBaby. The world watched the ups and downs of their romance in real-time—at least, what was shared on social media—causing the ex-couple to go viral on more than one occasion.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">They've long since broken up but that hasn't kept them away from scandal, as DaniLeigh's brother got into a physical altercation with DaBaby in a bowling alley.

"'Cause I felt like I kinda had to." Big Boy wanted to know which songs were previewed. "'Cap' and 'Call Me Out My Name,' 'cause those are the most deepest ones...'Cap' I'm angry." As far as DaBaby's response went, DaniLeigh said, "I mean, he's not a softy so he kinda like, laughed when I was like, '<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Keep your ho ass </a>where you at.' You know what I mean?"</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">She added that she felt "better" that she decided to play the tracks for him, saying that the remainder of EP was more "gentle."&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Check out DaniLeigh chopping it up with Big Boy below.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p>About The Author</p><p>Erika Marie is a seasoned journalist, editor, and ghostwriter who works predominantly in the fields of music, spirituality, mental health advocacy, and social activism.
