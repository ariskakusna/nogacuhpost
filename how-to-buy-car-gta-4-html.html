A Totally Rad Guide to Buying Cars in GTA IV (Because Stealing Gets Old)</h2><p data-sourcepos=3:1-3:403>Let's face it, stealing cars in Grand Theft Auto IV is as easy as breathing (especially after a night on McReary's special sauce). But what if you're feeling fancy, like a baller on the streets with a discerning taste for, well, not entirely wrecked vehicles? That's where this epic guide comes in, my friend. We're about to navigate the treacherous waters of <strong>actually buying a car</strong> in Liberty City.</p><h3 data-sourcepos=5:1-5:56>Gone Legit: The Two Shady Showrooms of Liberty City</h3><p data-sourcepos=7:1-7:205>Forget stealing hubs off parked rides – we're going legit (ish). Liberty City offers a <strong>whopping two</strong> dealerships where you can spend your hard-earned (or questionably acquired) cash. Here's the lowdown:</p><ul data-sourcepos=9:1-12:0><li data-sourcepos=9:1-10:0><p data-sourcepos=9:3-9:310><strong>Auto Eroticar (Alderney City):</strong> Now, the name might paint a strange picture, but trust me, this place is all about high-end sports cars. Think Ferraris that wouldn't look out of place in a mafia flick. They only sell one model, the <strong>Turismo</strong>, but hey, exclusivity has its price (and it's a sweet ride!).</p></li><li data-sourcepos=11:1-12:0><p data-sourcepos=11:3-11:270><strong>Grotti Showroom (Rodeo):</strong> Located on the glamorous (and fictional) Mulholland Drive, this showroom caters to a more discerning clientele. Here, you can snag yourself a luxurious <strong>Grotti Turismo</strong>. Yes, the same car as Auto Eroticar. Look, choices are good, right?</p></li></ul><p data-sourcepos=13:1-13:163><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Don't be fooled by the fancy showrooms, these guys ain't exactly offering deals. Saving up for that shiny new ride might take some extra bank heists.</p><h3 data-sourcepos=15:1-15:59>But Wait, There's More! (Because Stealing is Still Fun)</h3><p data-sourcepos=17:1-17:130>Alright, alright, so buying a car might not be your style. Maybe you crave the thrill of the steal? Here's a little bonus section:</p><ul data-sourcepos=19:1-22:0><li data-sourcepos=19:1-20:0><p data-sourcepos=19:3-19:236><strong>High-End Spawns:</strong> Cruise around certain areas of Algonquin and Alderney and you might just stumble upon a fancy car waiting to be "borrowed." Keep an eye out for Infernus and Comet spawns – they're sleek and perfect for a getaway.</p></li><li data-sourcepos=21:1-22:0><p data-sourcepos=21:3-21:229><strong>Brucie's Races:</strong> Befriend the flamboyant Brucie Kibbutz and participate in his street races. Winning (or strategically losing) can sometimes land you a sweet ride as a prize. Just be prepared for his exuberant celebrations.</p></li></ul><p data-sourcepos=23:1-23:165><strong>Remember:</strong> Stealing comes with a risk. That shiny new Infernus might attract unwanted attention from the LCPD. But hey, that's part of the GTA experience, right?</p><p data-sourcepos=25:1-25:271>So, there you have it! Your one-stop guide to acquiring a set of wheels in Liberty City, whether you prefer the legitimate route or the good ol' fashioned GTA steal. Now get out there and cruise in style (or ditch the car for a high-speed police chase – we won't judge).</p>2022-04-19T09:12:02.964+05:30<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvWrGWtnZOdfHN8kW1maWtfnby4edOoZJutqWKwor6MoKuaZWRjtbW5yw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
