After a broken engagement to Josh "Lazie" Resnik in 2012, she married tennis player Ryan Sweeting in 2013. The pair had only dated for three months when they got engaged. By 2015, they filed for divorce after just 21 months of marriage. As Cuoco later told <a href=#>Cosmopolitan</a>, their union was too rushed. "The person I ended up with was not the person I originally met," she shared. "That wasn't my fault â€” that was his."</p><p dir=ltr>The failed union put her off marriage, and she was certain she wouldn't walk down the aisle again. Jump to 2018 when she said "I do" to equestrian Karl Cook whom she met at a horse show in 2016. "It was very meant to be," she told The Talk (via <a href=#>ET</a>). Unfortunately, their union didn't last either, and they split in 2021. In a joint statement to&nbsp;<a href=#>People</a>, the couple explained, "We have realized that our current paths have taken us in opposite directions."</p><p dir=ltr>Cuoco finally met Mr. Right in April 2022 when her manager introduced her to fellow actor Tom Pelphrey. "It was love at first sight," she told <a href=#>USA Today</a>. "We were immediately connected." Indeed, in March 2023, they introduced their daughter, Matilda Carmine Richie Pelphrey, to the world. "@tommypelphrey didn't think I could fall even more in love with you, but I did," Cuoco gushed on <a href=#>Instagram</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma25jbYF5e9OhnGaqlZa5brjIn5xmqJGnwa%2Bx0axkqJ5dqbWmecGinmaakaO0bsDHnqarsV2YrrTAjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
