It's common to initially lose appetite under stress, but chronic stress often leads to increased cravings for sugary and fatty foods. This happens because our bodies produce more cortisol, a hormone that raises appetite. Such cravings can start a cycle: we seek comfort in food, feel guilt, and then lose motivation to exercise, leading to weight gain."</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Rebel Wilson convinces fans she has full body tattoos – see striking photo" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/1ef21a126a43-rebel-wilson-green-dress.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Rebel Wilson convinces fans she has full body tattoos – see striking photo" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Rebel Wilson convinces fans she has full body tattoos – see striking photo</a></h5></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Rebel Wilson stuns in a plunging neon orange swimsuit in photo from romantic island vacation" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/3f6913e2afef-rebel-wilson-blue-carpet.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Rebel Wilson stuns in a plunging neon orange swimsuit in photo from romantic island vacation" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Rebel Wilson stuns in a plunging neon orange swimsuit in photo from romantic island vacation</a></h5></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Rebel Wilson shares adorable pic of daughter during sun-soaked vacation" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/1a3277edf634-1847155657728162634022083662498205145546005n.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Rebel Wilson shares adorable pic of daughter during sun-soaked vacation" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Rebel Wilson shares adorable pic of daughter during sun-soaked vacation</a></h5></li></ul><p id=etuRjePo6H data-wc=61>She continued: "It's natural to seek comfort when stressed, and being kind to yourself is crucial.
