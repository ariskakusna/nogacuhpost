Thomas even shared the same caption on his own Instagram <a href=#>post</a> but posted different photos of him and Midthunder canoodling.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>According to <a href=#>CBC</a>, Thomas is a co-host of the <a href=#>"Foxing Around" podcast</a>, where he highlights stories of Indigenous people.
