"I believe he was <a href=#>murdered</a>," she said, adding, "That's all there is to it."&nbsp;In her memoir, David Carradine: The Eye of My Tornado, she asserts that the details around his passing, including what was apparently found during his <a href=#>autopsy</a>, "just don't fit."</p><p>Anderson acknowledges that Carradine did engage in kinky sex practices during the time that they were married from 1998 to 2001, including "a penchant for bondage and being choked to the point of orgasm," per ABC News. However, she noted why the report concerning his death doesn't make sense, explaining, "For David to accidentally do it to himself, that's not the act. He never flew solo when we were together. That didn't fit the scenario. David liked participation."&nbsp;</p><p>She continued by noting that "you can't have marks around your neck by just doing an autoerotic or sexual asphyxiation," saying that "it went over the line. There was something really hinky that happened." Anderson also has a theory as to what that "hinky"&nbsp;occurrence may have been.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma2ppbYB4e9OhoKefo2LGsMGMnaCdpqRiuK%2B71maYm6elqXqlrdWim2abkae%2ForDIp5ysZZ2uwLWx0aKmrqtdmbKiwMdo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
