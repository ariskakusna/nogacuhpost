We're all going to heaven because of <a href=#>Kimberly</a>. She's just so sweet."</p><p dir=ltr>Schlapman's daughter Daisy is five months older than Penelopi and according to <a href=#>The Boot's</a> reporting, the girls are best friends. Schlapman told the outlet, "They adore each other. The two of them have just been best little buddies since their first few weeks of life!"</p><p dir=ltr>Arthur is also close friends with Luke Bryan's wife, Caroline. In an interview on the&nbsp;Get Real podcast, Bryan admitted she and Arthur bonded over a flask. Bryan said that the first time they met at a red carpet event, she and Luke had just gotten engaged. "So...I don't know anybody. Here comes this girl...and she goes, 'Hey I'm Becky.' And she's like, 'I'm here with Phillip from Little Big Town.'...Becky had on this beautiful low-cut dress, and I said, 'I'm gonna be here for a while because Luke is gonna be talking for a while. God, I really wish I had a drink.' She pulled a flask out of her cleavage. I went, 'I don't know who you are, but I like you.' That's how you start a great friendship."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbHBlbYBye9ahpmaho2K9qbXLpaCpZaOssqbA0mauop6VYr%2BmrsScmpplkafBqcHRaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
