Many people&nbsp;felt a lot of factors led to his firing and still lament over the fact that AEW cost themselves dearly.</p><p>While speaking on&nbsp;<a href=#>Sportskeeda’s Wrestling Time Machine</a>&nbsp;hosted by Mac Davis, WWE Hall of Famer Teddy Long talked about Seth Rollins and CM Punk’s blistering promo on RAW this week. Long stated that he believes AEW fumbled CM Punk and didn’t let him reach his potential due to jealousy.</p><p>“They missed that [the segments] in AEW because of jealousy. You know, they were worried about somebody coming in, taking their spot, as Mac would say. You know that’s how they missed it. You know they had this clique right here and ‘we don’t need you over here.’ That’s what’s missing in the wrestling business. Please, gentlemen, let’s just try to work together. Just cause I don’t like you doesn’t mean we can’t work together.”</p><p>Even AEW President&nbsp;<a href=#>Tony Khan has broken his silence regarding CM Punk’s WWE return</a>&nbsp;at the Survivor Series Premium Live Event. Chris Jericho also revealed what the AEW locker <a href=#>room thought of CM Punk’s WWE return</a>. We’ll have to see how Punk will continue to be booked in the coming weeks, as WWE is truly his home again.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>What do you think of what Teddy Long said about jealousy holding back CM Punk in AEW?
