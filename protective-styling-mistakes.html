[Your hair will] grow at its best potential while switching up hairstyles that are either wigs, weaves, twists or box braids," shares Alan Fretias stylist at Warren Tricomi.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, when you have a protective style, it's important that you still care for your natural hair too, since there are mistakes we make that can actually combat the benefits of having a protective hairstyle.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here, Fretias shares the top right mistakes you didn't know you were making with your protective style.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-skipping-wash-days></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Skipping Wash Days</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This is probably the number one rule when it comes to protective styling. So let's go ahead and disband the rumor that states you don't need to care for your natural hair when you have in a weave.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Your shampoo, condition, and deep conditioning treatments are crucial weekly," says Fretias. "A <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>healthy clean scalp</a> equals a healthy hair follicle leading to healthy hair growth and longer hair."

Girl, let your hair breathe.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Every two to three months you should break from your protective hairstyle," the stylist shares. "[Preform] a proper cleanse and deep conditioning treatments for at least a month [before attempting a new style]."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When removing your protective style try<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow> Curls Hair Under There Detox Tea Cleanser</a>.

Otherwise, protective styles and tension of any kind can actually tug at your hair and cause more hair loss and thinning.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Stick to more natural hair ingredients full of moisture like avocados, olive oils, honey, and eggs," says Fretias. "The best stuff for hair has an expiration!"</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-forgetting-your-nighttime-routine></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Forgetting Your Nighttime Routine</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">No baby girl, don't just pass out after a long day at work or a night of partying. You have to make sure you have all the right nighttime essentials to ensure your hair stays moisturized and frizz-free.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Nighttime routine is super important and cotton pillowcases are not for hair — instead, use silk pillowcases and bonnets," Fretias recommends. If you can't afford silk, satin is a great substitute and has the same properties as silk. They are both good for your hair, having breathable fabrics that are less absorbent, which allows the moisture to stay on your strands, not the pillowcase.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-ignoring-your-scalp></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Ignoring Your Scalp</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Protective styles get itchy and dry when not moisturized daily. The best way to combat this is by using a natural oil daily to alleviate the scalp from itchiness and dryness," shares Fretias. Inject your hair with some hydration with<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow> Shea Moisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Strengthen & Restore Hair Serum</a>.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-foregoing-regular-trims></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Foregoing Regular Trims</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the quest for hair length, a big mistake people make with protective styles is neglecting regular trims. "You should be getting a trim every six to 10 weeks," says Fretias.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-leaving-your-protective-style-in-too-long></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Leaving Your Protective Style in Too Long</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Fresh braids are cute. Super old braids are not. Leaving braids in for longer than they are supposed to be is a major no-no, and common mistake curly girls make with their protective styles.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Leaving your braids in for too long can cause build-up and tangles, which leads to hair becoming or getting damaged when being taken out," explains Fretias. If you do misstep. then try <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Dark & Lovely Detangling Cream</a> — with peppermint and avocado oil, it loosens product build-up and helps the takedown process.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-not-using-the-right-products></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Not Using the Right Products</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When you have a protective hairstyle, you must focus on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>hydration</a> and scalp health. Pay attention to what's in the products you are using, knowing that the products that are first are the most concentrated in the formula. "Stay away from silicones," warns Fretias. "Silicones create a great slip, protective barrier from heat styling, but over time it leads hair to become brittle, broken, and dry. It suffocates the follicle from not allowing moisture into [the hair follicle and strands.]" Fretias highly recommends hyaluronic acids as it's "wonderful for moisture." Give <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Monat Advanced Hydrating Haircare</a> a try. One of the first hair care brands to experiment with hyaluronic acid for hair, this shampoo and conditioner set will saturate your strands with hydration, leaving it moisturized, soft, and healthy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This is <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>All Natural</a>.
