Fary continued. "What if there was this consolation prize of sorts?”&nbsp;</p><p>This year's "consolation prize" is a goodie bag worth $178,410, according to Distinctive Assets, and features a slew of expensive gifts, including a three-night stay in Switzerland, a three-night stay at a private villa in St. Barts, and a seven-day holistic wellness retreat.</p><p>The gift bags are reserved for host Jimmy Kimmel and every nominee in the major acting and directing categories.</p><p>According to The Wall Street Journal, the Academy stopped offering nominees gift bags itself, citing the "upfront tax burden they placed on stars."</p><p>As Fary told the publication, the expensive gift bag items are "actually just offers," meaning brands provide "invitations for services, objects and experiences" that, unlike gift cards, are not taxable. It's up to the nominees to actually redeem the offers, and according to Fary no one has ever "come close" to redeeming every voucher that comes in a gift bag.</p><p>Not all of the more than 60 gifts are high-price items, either. According to the same The Wall Street Journal report, this year's gift bag also features a $9 case of soda, a $15 Rubik's Cube and $80 worth of black licorice.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SSSXV8J7paH7YkmpxcYR9W-1920-80.jpg><p>Fary told The Wall Street Journal that he came up with idea to offer gift bag to prestigious nominees after he watched Better Midler go home empty-handed after the 1994 Emmy Awards.</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.

Award-winning director Ron Howard also redeemed an offer to stay a luxury resort in Connecticut, and Melissa McCarthy&nbsp;used a voucher to commission a custom piece of artwork for her husband, Ben Falcone, for his birthday.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RopycpJGev6Z6wqikaJuVobKjvsitsGZqYGeBbrvSnJirq12ctqfAjJuYoGWZo8CqsMRo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
