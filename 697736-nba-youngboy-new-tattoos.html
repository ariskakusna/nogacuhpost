The rapper is already pretty famous for his facial tattoos. But now, according to a post from No Jumper, he has added a few more. There appear to be two additions to YoungBoy's collection. The first is a small coffin on his forehead. The interior of the design is a spiderweb and an inverted cross. Meanwhile, the other new design is a simple black skull and crossbones behind his ear. The tattoos didn't go over especially well online, with many people lamenting that YoungBoy had a bad artist.</p><p>New ink isn't the only thing that YoungBoy is drawing headlines for, however. The rapper went viral for dancing with a fan for the second time in a week. Meanwhile, the rapper also made bold assertions about his son, the grandson of <a href=# class=text-word rel="nofollow noopener">Floyd Mayweather</a>. When asked in a phone interview if his son was going to become a boxer, YoungBoy declared that he was actually <a href=# rel>going to become a UFC fighter</a> instead.</p><p><strong>Read More</strong>: <a href=# rel>NBA YoungBoy loses federal appeal</a></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-nba-youngboy-s-new-tattoos>NBA YoungBoy's New Tattoos</h2></span><p>NBA YoungBoy isn't the only rapper with face tattoos making headlines in recent days. <a href=# class=text-word rel>Kodak Black</a> dropped the first live performance of his verse on 6ix9ine's "Shaka Laka" while performing on Day One of Rolling Loud Miami. Meanwhile, Black's audio engineer revealed that a bar had been cut from the track. According to the engineer's Instagram, Black originally included the line “So raw got a rat giving me cheese” in his verse.</p><p>Of course, the bar is a reference to the snitching allegations that have followed 6ix9ine for several years. These claims stem from the plea deal 6ix9ine cut during the 2018/19 trial of the Nine Trey Gangsters organization. The rapper saw a reduced sentence in exchange for testifying against other members of the group. However, it’s not the first time that recent lyricism on a 6ix9ine song is getting attention. When teasing his <a href=# rel>return to the rap game</a>, 6ix9ine dropped a clip where the bar “If you see the cops shhh don’t make it hot” could be heard. People immediately clowned 6ix9ine for dropping an anti-snitching line.</p><p>[<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">via</a>]</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmboR4f5VmpZuZXa68trrGm6ayZZ6axG7AwK2rqKej</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
