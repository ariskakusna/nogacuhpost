Not only did he not win the bout, but he also ended up getting injured and will now miss WrestleMania 40.</p><p>Dave Meltzer of the <a href=#>Wrestling Observer</a> reported that Punk suffered a “significant” injury during the match. The exact nature of the injury was unconfirmed by WWE officials, and there has been speculation within WWE that it could be a torn triceps, but nothing was officially confirmed.</p><p>“His exact injury was unconfirmed by those in WWE past many confirming the injury and that as of right now the plan is to have him on the show from Tampa to address the nature of the injury. Within the WWE the speculation was a torn triceps but nobody close enough to the situation would confirm anything more than a significant injury to be addressed on the show.”</p><p>However, according to <a href=#>PWInsider</a>, it was confirmed that CM Punk suffered a torn triceps injury, sustained at the Royal Rumble Premium Live Event. It was noted that he will miss out on WrestleMania 40, with a recovery time of 4-6 months after surgery.</p><p>‘‘CM Punk’s dreams of headlining Wrestlemania will likely not be realized this year.’‘</p><p>”PWInsider.com can confirm that Punk is believed to have suffered a torn triceps during the Men’s Royal Rumble match.&nbsp; The severity of the tear has not been confirmed but Punk is believed to heading towards surgery after an appearance on tonight’s Raw.&nbsp; Punk is in Tampa for the show.”</p><p>”The belief among sources we have spoken with is that post-surgery, Punk would likely&nbsp;need in the area of 4-6 months of recovery and physical therapy.&nbsp; If correct, that would obviously put him out of Wrestlemania as a wrestler and if he gets the surgery within the next week, it likely means he wouldn’t be able to return to the ring until this summer in a best case scenario.”</p><p>CM Punk was likely supposed to compete in the Elimination Chamber match and win it in order to challenge Seth Rollins for the World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania 40.</p><p>Unfortunately, all hopes of his WrestleMania main event have been dashed and fans are likely to be devasted by such terrible news. It is expected he will open RAW this week and announce his injury, so we’ll have to see how he will address his injury status.</p><p>What do you think of this unfortunate CM Punk story?
