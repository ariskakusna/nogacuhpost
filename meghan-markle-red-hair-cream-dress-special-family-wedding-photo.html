In the first, the Duchess could be seen applying the finishing touches to Ashleigh's bridal makeup, with the bride-to-be rocking a casual shirt with her dark hair styled into an intricate low bun.</p><p id=egmWz7xYXKLR data-wc=34>In the next snap, Ashleigh sported glowing makeup and wore a strapless wedding dress with a sweetheart neckline and full skirt, with one hand holding her white bouquet and the other around Meghan's waist.</p><p id=e1aJPNGmnUMb data-wc=1><strong>TRENDING:&nbsp;</strong><a aria-label="Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's virtual date photos are so cute" class=hm-link href=#>Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's virtual date photos are so cute</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ea8c9630f89a-ashleigh-netflix-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eCCgZJ-1SvQY data-wc=9><strong>Ashleigh emotionally opened up about her relationship with Meghan</strong></p><p id=eMXmlAddZT4z data-wc=71>The royal rocked noticeably shorter, auburn hair compared to her current locks, and she proved her long-standing love of muted tones by wearing a cream chiffon dress with semi-sheer balloon sleeves and a V-neck. It's an unwritten rule that cream and white are not worn at weddings to prevent upstaging the bride, but they have become much more common, with some brides – including royals – even choosing white bridesmaid dresses.</p><p id=eQ0fTF2RjHhW data-wc=33>Ashleigh was later moved to tears as she spoke about being "hurt on some level" that she was banned from&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>the royal wedding in 2018</a> under palace guidance, due to the fact her estranged mother Samantha wasn't invited.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/6709207d67af-meghan-markle-wedding-chapel-harry-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eXeyYKzPtCwB data-wc=20><strong>The Duchess of Sussex claimed that she was advised not to invite her niece to her royal wedding in 2018</strong></p><p id=eFZQL44GIKGf data-wc=37>"To know that because of my biological mother that this relationship that was so important to me was impacted in that way, to feel like because of her it was taken away, it's been hard," Ashleigh said.</p><p id=ewXQ97I1xxH3 data-wc=42>Meghan also relived the "painful" moment, saying: "How do we explain that this half-sister isn't invited to the wedding, but the half-sister's daughter is?
