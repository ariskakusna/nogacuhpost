The New Jersey beauty told&nbsp;<a href=#>Baltimore Outloud&nbsp;</a>that she's had a variety of jobs in her lifetime. "I've been a waitress â€” the person struggling, the person who has money," Dolores opened up. "I've had relationships when I was happy and unhappy. I was a mother that was married and then a single mother. I learned something from each stage of my life."</p><p>Per <a href=#>Bravo</a>, she even worked as a corrections officer, surgical assistant, and <a href=#>real estate agent</a> before opening multiple <a href=#>Powerhouse Fitness Center</a> gyms. Per <a href=#>Cheat Sheet</a>, Dolores and ex Frank Catania also invest in flipping houses. Even better? Dolores reportedly earns between $30,000 and $60,000 per&nbsp;RHONJ&nbsp;episode, via&nbsp;<a href=#>Floor 8</a>.&nbsp;Dolores first appeared on the hit reality series in 2009 as a "guest star," but her lead cast position was cemented as full-time for Season 7.&nbsp;</p><p>All of that hard work has certainly paid off.&nbsp;According to&nbsp;<a href=#>The Things</a>, Dolores is worth approximately $4 million. Yet what's most important to Dolores, besides providing for her family, is giving back.&nbsp;"I like to be part of fundraisers and platforms where I know where the money is going," Dolores told&nbsp;Baltimore Outloud.&nbsp;She frequently contributes to St. Joe's Hospital in Paterson and the animal activism group Onyx & Breezy. This Housewife is far more than just a pretty face!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbGpoaoJxe8eeqZ6rXZ28uHnMrpqhZaKdvK%2B2jKyrmqpdmbytu9Geqmabkamur7XAZqCsZaKarq242GauqKqknXw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
