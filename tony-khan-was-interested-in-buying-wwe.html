There were several possible buyers on the table, but only Endeavor was picked. Although Tony Khan didn’t land the deal to buy his competition, AEW’s President was certainly interested.</p><p>Although he didn’t go into many details, Tony Khan said that he was interested in buying WWE while speaking to <a href=#>The Maggie & Perloff Show</a>. This would have been a huge moment in pro wrestling history if AEW bought their giant competition.</p><p>Although Tony Khan did not land the big deal, the fact is that he won’t take his eyes off the new company. After all, this groundbreaking merger could change the entire pro wrestling landscape.</p><p>“It will be very interesting to see what happens with that sale. Certainly, in many ways, it’s a big positive to the pro wrestling business.”</p><p>“The huge attendance numbers and TV and streaming numbers for pro wrestling and the great sales for AEW on PPV and all the big merchandising numbers show that pro wrestling is really back as an industry in many major ways in 2023 and AEW is a big part of the conversation,” he said. So, I think that’s all been really positive for us.”</p><p>WWE and UFC’s deal will go through, provided the government doesn’t intervene, and they will be traded under the stock name TKO. Only time will tell what the entire situation looks like in a few years, but Tony Khan might end up wishing that he would have pushed a bit harder to buy WWE.</p><p>Vince McMahon was very much involved in the deal to buyout WWE. The ongoing idea out there is that McMahon picked Endeavor, because they were one of the few interested buyers who wanted to keep him around the company.</p><p>What’s your take on this situation?
