God DC looks better and better</p>— Kal-el (@Iwishiwashim12) <a href=#>July 31, 2017</a><p>"Can we just get off of feminism and social justice and actually print stories," one person tweeted, to reiterate, in response to women drinking milkshakes.&nbsp;He was joined by replies that included "Looks like a bunch of SWJ's to me" and "How all these Tumblr SJW fake geek girls club are editors at Marvel?"&nbsp;</p><p>Another tweeted "I would totally bang the girl in front," which lead one to reply, "Better have her sign a consent form, she looks like the 'false rape charge'&nbsp;type."</p><span></span><p lang=en dir=ltr>This does explain the "quality" of work Marvel has been putting out of late.</p>— Michael Fesser (@Michael_Fesser) <a href=#>July 31, 2017</a> <span></span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Better have her sign a consent form, she looks like the "false rape charge" type.</p>— The Bechtloff (@thebechtloff) <a href=#>July 30, 2017</a> <span></span><p lang=en dir=ltr>How all these Tumblr SJW fake geek girls club are editors at Marvel?</p>— BAR_DD (@BAR199323) <a href=#>July 31, 2017</a><p>Antos condemned the abuse the following day, writing that "the internet is an awful, horrible, and disgusting place." She added, "Woke up today to a slew of more garbage tweets and DMs. For being a woman. In comics. Who posted a selfie of her friends getting milkshakes."</p><span></span><p lang=en dir=ltr>How dare I post a picture of my friends on the internet without expecting to be bullied, insulted, harrassed, and targeted.</p>— Heather Antos (@HeatherAntos) <a href=#>July 30, 2017</a><p>She was quickly backed up by an abundance of supporters, however, many of whom posted their own milkshake-drinking selfies under the hashtag "#MakeMineMilkshake".</p><p>But the incident has once again ignited a firestorm of discussion about the prevalence of&nbsp;abusive responses to both gender and racial diversity in the comic book world, and the recent increase in female staffers.</p><p>Chelsea Cain, the writer behind the female superhero comic book Mockingbird, left Twitter in October 2016 following months of harassment, while&nbsp;Zainab Akhtar, a British-Muslim&nbsp;writer, closed her Eisner Award-winning comic book journalism site Comics & Cola last year after being deluged with racist, misogynistic abuse via email and social media.</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>Kamala Khan, Marvel's first Muslim superhero to headline her own title</span></figure><p>It also follows an April scandal in which Marvel's VP of Sales David Gabriel <a href=#>appeared to blame character diversity for the company's recent sales decline</a>. While Gabriel's stance was music to the ears of a minority of comic book fandom, others rallied, blaming the company's insistence on crossovers and stories that require the purchasing of multiple different books, and criticising Gabriel for seemingly using non-white characters as an easy scapegoat for the across-the-boards Marvel sales decline.</p><p>"During the discussion, retailers pointed out during the summit that the number of Marvel events, and the fact that they overlap, make it hard for fans to focus," reported&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>io9</a>&nbsp;at the time. "Right now, for instance, there's&nbsp;Secret Empire,&nbsp;which will bleed over with&nbsp;Generations, which starts this summer. In the past two years alone, there have been&nbsp;at least&nbsp;12 events and crossovers. Events, in particular, have become more of a chore than a reward."</p><p>Gabriel later retracted&nbsp;his comments.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbHLnp6rmaCde6S7ja6iaJqfpLi0e82erqxnlpq6orjEZqSaqqaauW6vzqagnKtdmrGqwM6rZKGZopbAtLHDZqanpJmjsm65yKWirKCRoLJuv8SlnaKdXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
