In a Montreality interview from a few years back, Curry explained that <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">he met XXXTentacion during a party at the ULT House </a>and proceeded to invite the rapper to move in and work on music -- if only to keep him out of trouble. From there, the pair proceeded to go their separate ways, but not before laying down their lone collaboration on wax -- "SPACEGHOSTPUSSY," which featured Triple X holding it down with an aggressive contribution.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/urbanlinx.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/userfiles/78/23/962378_b6880a59f398a5b19acaeeaa38852ecf.jpg><p><h6>Bennett Raglin/Getty Images</h6></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Following Triple X's death in June of 2018, Denzel Curry opened up about their occasionally complicated dynamic, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">revealing the deep trust that existed between them</a>. "We basically don't understand each other, yet we're so much alike," explained&nbsp;Denzel, speaking with Mass Appeal. "We went to understand who we both were. Even when it came down to the darkest shit that he can tell me in his life, and I tell him the darkest shit to happen in my life."&nbsp;Clearly, there was a respect between the two defining Floridian voices, and many fans wish that they were able to collaborate more before Triple X's untimely murder.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">From the sound of it, Denzel shares that wish. During an impromptu Twitter Q&A spree --&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">one that found him revealing some baggage with A$AP Rocky</a> as well as&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">calling out Travis Scott's "funky" attitude</a> -- Denzel confirmed that he and X had planned on recording new music together. It's unclear as to whether such plans were outlined more specifically,&nbsp;but seeing the role Denzel played in supporting Triple X in those early years at the ULT House, it wouldn't&nbsp;have been surprising&nbsp;for things to come full circle. Alas, that day will never come.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Check out Denzel's response to an XXXTentacion question below, and sound off -- do you think they could have dropped off a classic track?&nbsp;</p><p>About The Author</p><p>&lt;b>Feature Editor&lt;/b> &lt;!--BR--> Mitch Findlay is a writer and hip-hop journalist based in Montreal.
