Of course, <a href=# rel=noopener>Rihanna’s Super Bowl halftime show announcement</a> was amazing. <a href=#>Kourtney Kardashian</a> recreating the “All The Small Things” music video at a Blink-182 concert to announce that she was expecting a baby with husband Travis Barker was iconic. And Olympic gold medalist <a href=#>Shawn Johnson</a> announced that she was expecting Baby No. 3 with husband Andrew East in the most perfect location: At the Panathenaic Stadium in Athens in front of the Olympic rings.</p><p>All that said, we do love a good surprise too! We were floored in 2023 when celebrities like <a href=#>Paris Hilton</a>, <a href=# rel=noopener>Ashley Olsen</a>, and Chrissy Teigen shocked the world with unexpected birth announcements, having given no signal that a baby was on the way. And yes, Hilton and Teigen both did it&nbsp;twice&nbsp;in one year.</p><p>Just a few days into 2024, we’ve already seen some super sweet pregnancy announcements from the likes of actress Rose McGiver (at the Golden Globes), country music singer Jon Pardi, and HGTV star Drew Scott. And now we can’t wait for all the announcements to come! Below, we’ve listed every famous figure who announced in 2024 that they’re expecting a new addition to their family.

It was crazy and overwhelming and so hard not to scream it from the rooftops.

At the time, Miller was hospitalized for an ectopic pregnancy and had to have a fallopian tube removed.</p><p>“After what happened last time, I didn’t even know if I’d even want to get pregnant again in case I had to go through that again,” Miller told the outlet. “It sounds cliché, but it really is our little miracle. This is what I’m so excited for, to be able to tell people it is possible.”</p><p>Miller sweetly relayed that her mom was the first person she told, given that she is living with her mom and Holmes is living with a friend while they wait to move into a new home.</p><p>“As soon as I took the pregnancy test, I came out of the bathroom, and she was literally walking past my room, and so I said, ‘Oh my God, Mum,'” Miller said. “We were both just hugging each other in tears. She’s been so good. If I come through the door even holding a shopping bag from the supermarket, she’ll be like, ‘No, no, no, no, no. Let me take that. Let me take that.'”</p><p>Holmes did not have quite the same reaction at first. “I wish I recorded his reaction because it looked like someone had seen a ghost,” Miller said. “I’ll say it wasn’t the reaction I was hoping for, but he’s more of a realist. I think, because of what happened last time, he was just very skeptical, and he was just worried, I think, is what it came down to. He was just like, ‘But what if it happens again?'”</p><p>Since then, he’s gotten so excited, Miller shared, and the two can’t wait for their “miracle” baby who is due in June 2024.</p></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLTEpKWor6NjsLC5jqmYq52eqbavs46so6Kclai1sMOOa3Bsa2lshXCvxKWcm6qZqcZuvNGenqeZnpjGbq3Np6auppOauqa606xka2hiaXw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
