Also, Chels kept saying the room was too dark, then proceeded to put down dark floors, and paint the walls AND ceilings dark green."</p><p>A third wrote: "The whole design seemed to hang together except for that horrendous fireplace. Maybe it was different in person but it seemed like a gigantic white-ish blob amidst earth tones and black. Just awful. Also, would’ve 100% left the ceiling unpainted."</p><p>Others thought the designs were "hideous," harshly calling the entire project "a huge waste of money."</p><h2>TIME TO CELEBRATE</h2><p>But Chelsea and Cole were very proud of their work and celebrated their return to television at a <a href=#>premiere party</a> on Monday.</p><p>The former <a href=#>Teen Mom 2</a> star shared photos on social media from the evening, in which she donned a skintight red dress with long sleeves that showed off her cleavage, paired with black cowgirl boots.</p><p>She completed the look by sporting her long dark locks straight down.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Cole went for a button-down with slacks, and her daughter Aubree, 13, whom she shares with ex-boyfriend Adam Lind, looked all grown up in a black dress with combat boots.</p><p>New episodes of <a href=#>Down Home Fab</a> air at 9pm EST Mondays on HGTV and are also available on Discovery+.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/01/downhill-fab-teen-mom-fans-789044151-1.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/01/chelsea-houskas-down-home-fab-782883607.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/01/chelsea-houska-celebrates-hgtv-premiere-789050480-2.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hvYWqDd4SQaKuenZ5iurC5jJyfnqSjmq5utM6uqqSZXZi8rbGMnZybp5Wneqm7zJ5km62jnrumv9JmnKaomaeycA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
