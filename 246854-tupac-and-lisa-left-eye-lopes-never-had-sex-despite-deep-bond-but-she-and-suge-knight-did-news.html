Among <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">the details shared</a>, the truth about Lisa's suspected affair with Tupac, who was friends with Andre,&nbsp;is brought to light, as&nbsp;well as a surprising revelation about&nbsp;Lisa and Tupac's boss at the time, Suge Knight.</p><p>The documentary&nbsp;discusses how Lisa and Andre&nbsp;were in an "on-and-off relationship," and would "fight often"&nbsp; and "break up for months." All parties, including Andre,&nbsp;wholeheartedly agree that <a href=# rel>Lisa was in love with Tupac</a>, calling him "her soulmate" and&nbsp;noting that "if Tupac was willing to go there, then Lisa would have definitely dated [him]." However, despite&nbsp;countless suspicions over the years, everyone in the documentary confirms that Lisa&nbsp;never&nbsp;slept with Tupac. Though Andre, who "knew how Lisa felt about Pac," claimed&nbsp;that&nbsp;"Lisa would always deny that she slept with Pac, and I still didn't believe it," another interviewee&nbsp;insists that "Tupac told Lisa in the very beginning, 'Never let me sleep with you,' and they stood by that."</p><p>Scott Gries/Getty Images</p><p>However, after Tupac's death in 1996, "Lisa was&nbsp;devastated." Though&nbsp;she and Andre got engaged, she quickly called off the wedding, and the two went their separate ways for good. When <a href=# rel>Lisa wanted to leave TLC and go in her own creative direction</a>, she approached Suge Knight at Death Row Records, and they started working together. However, Suge reveals that their relationship was more than just professional. "...it&nbsp;was a sexual relationship, I had major love for her...I cared for her," he revealed. Andre confirms that Lisa "had relations with Suge...and that's&nbsp;just messy." Messy, indeed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdiaYN5gZNmq66okZh6orrDZqOiq5Fiuaay02acsp1dobyxsdJmpZ6ulad6qa3DZqqesF2ZsrS8yK2cZpyVmr1urs6nm2aapal6tLTEZpinnF2owqixjKSlop%2BYqXqltcNmpZ6vow%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
