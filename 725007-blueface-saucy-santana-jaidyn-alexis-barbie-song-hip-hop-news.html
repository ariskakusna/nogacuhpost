Of course, given all their antics and the scandals they created or were in, focusing on just the music is difficult. That being said, the California rapper recently thanked a fellow MC for showing Alexis some support, and putting people onto a banger without regarding the headlines. Moreover, Saucy Santana recently posted an Instagram Story that showed him <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">turning up to her new song "Barbie"</a> (which <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">released</a> on October 2) during his concert in the video clip. Via Twitter, the "BDD" MC shouted Santana out for making the track connect with a lot of new listeners and fans.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Fastest growing artist I’ve ever seen," Blueface began a series of tweets on Sunday (October 15) about Jaidyn Alexis and her brand new single. "I’m impressed my dam self 4 months 4 songs. [medal emoji] [star emoji] [record disk emoji]. My b***h doing better then yo b***h [crying-laughing emoji]. My b***h song playing in every club rn. Big shoutout to saucy santana he put y’all on fr."</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-blueface-appreciates-saucy-santana-s-promo>Blueface Appreciates Saucy Santana's Promo</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Last week, Blueface responded to claims that he wrote "Barbie" for Jaidyn Alexis on social media. "Come one, cuh. <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Y'all really think I wrote that?</a>" he expressed. "I'm a whole [displaying gang sings] out here, cuh. You really think I wrote that? Dead homies? That's disrespectful, cuh. So, y'all calling a n***a zesty, cuh That's what y'all saying? Dead homies? School Yard Crip? That n***a that just [fakes pulling out gun, shooting gun, and punching]? The n***a that do all the issues? Y'all calling me zesty, cuh? So, if I wrote them lyrics, that mean I'm zesty?"</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Meanwhile, we'll see whether there are any other big singles to come from any of these artists before 2023 wraps up. It's wild to look back on everything that these individuals were involved in drama-wise over the past twelve months. Come December, it might be an even wilder retrospective. On that note, stick around on HNHH for the latest on Blueface, Jaidyn Alexis, and Saucy Santana.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Gabriel Bras Nevares is a music and pop culture news writer for HotNewHipHop. He started in 2022 as a weekend writer and, since joining the team full-time, has developed a strong knowledge in hip-hop news and releases. Whether it’s regular coverage or occasional interviews and album reviews, he continues to search for the most relevant news for his audience and find the best new releases in the genre. What excites him the most is finding pop culture stories of interest, as well as a deeper passion for the art form of hip-hop and its contemporary output. Specifically, Gabriel enjoys the fringes of rap music: the experimental, boundary-pushing, and raw alternatives to the mainstream sound. As a proud native of San Juan, Puerto Rico, he also stays up-to-date with the archipelago’s local scene and its biggest musical exponents in reggaetón, salsa, indie, and beyond. Before working at HotNewHipHop, Gabriel produced multiple short documentaries, artist interviews, venue spotlights, and audio podcasts on a variety of genres and musical figures. Hardcore punk and Go-go music defined much of his coverage during his time at the George Washington University in D.C. His favorite hip-hop artists working today are Tyler, The Creator, Boldy James, JPEGMAFIA, and Earl Sweatshirt.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdnZ4JxfJZmmaWtlZuupLGMrJium6liwKK605qlmmWalralxc1mmKWdqJ7Abq7Aq5minV2ovK%2BzjKGgqWWYpL1uusSwqg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
