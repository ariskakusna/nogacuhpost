After domestic violence allegations were filed back in early May by his baby momma Lydia Nam, the Radio Killah was forced to turn himself in to NYPD for questioning before posting bail at a hefty $20,000. While maintaining his innocence against his accuser, Dream has otherwise remained fairy quiet about the whole ordeal after making his initial comments. Filmed on father's day, new footage released by&nbsp;TMZ&nbsp;this afternoon finds the hit maker (no pun intended) elaborating his stance on the case. <a href=../../23372-the-dream-addresses-domestic-abuse-allegations-news.html>Read More...</a></section></article><article class=list-item itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Blog><h2 class=headline itemprop=headline><a href=../../drmtlgy-brightening-eye-masks-review-8356297.html>These Brightening Eye Masks Work Better on My Dark Circles Than Filler</a></h2><div class=meta><span class=key>published on</span>

Since I was a child, darkness has haunted my eye hollows, which get even darker and puffier if I’m sleep-deprived.

"I believe he was murdered," she said, adding, "That's all there is to it."&nbsp;In her memoir, David Carradine: The Eye of My Tornado, she asserts that the details around his passing, including what was apparently found during his autopsy, "just don't fit."
