"My gorgeous birthday boy!!! 1 today!! X," wrote Coleen next to a black-and-white image of the cute toddler.

"Can't believe my baby is 1 tomorrow!!! Time goes TOO quick!!" she captioned a snap of her preparations, which included a collection of blue and white balloons, more than ten presents wrapped up in brightly coloured paper, and a cake in the shape of a car.</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on X</a><p id=e-dGSunhpi1C data-wc=70>Doting mum Coleen has previously revealed to <strong>HELLO!&nbsp;</strong>magazine that she would like to expand her brood. "I'd probably like another one â€” not too soon though," she said at the end of last year. "I think a girl would complete the family but because the boys get on so well, another boy would be just as nice. But at the moment life's good.
