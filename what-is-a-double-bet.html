Bet types explained</h3><p><span class=m_first-letter>T</span>he double bet is one of the simplest forms of a multiple that a punter can place and it is made up of just two outright/single bets with the odds combined together into one. It is a popular way of betting for many and should continue to be during this year’s World Cup.&nbsp;</p><p>To win a double bet, both selections must be successful. However, if one or both of the selections are unsuccessful, you will lose the bet.&nbsp;</p><p>The odds of a double bet will be greater than if you were to place two single bets, but the risk is greater of losing as you need both selections to be successful to be paid out your winnings.&nbsp;</p><p>Double bets are popular in a lot of sports such as football, tennis, horse racing and rugby and all can be combined for doubles.</p><p>This is set to be no different during the World Cup, especially during the busy group stage where there’s set to be four matches per day.<br></p><h3>How are double bet odds worked out?</h3><p>The odds for a double bet are worked out by taking the odds of each single bet and then multiplying those to create your double bet odds. The other way to work out double bet odds is that the money won from your first bet would be put as a stake on the second selection. See below for a double bet example.</p><p>Already used the&nbsp;<a href=#>bet365 bonus code</a>?

The odds for this double bet would be:</p><p>4/1 x 2/1 = 14/1</p><p>The multiplication may look odd, but remember that your stake is added to each part of the bet. So</p><p>£5 @ 4/1 = £20 winnings + £5 stake = £25;&nbsp;</p><p>£25 @ 2/1 = £50 winnings + £25 stake = £75</p><p>If both Portugal and England win their matches in 90 minutes, then you will have a double bet winner. If either or both selections draw or lose, then your double bet will be unsuccessful.<br></p><p><i><b>Successful double bet winnings:</b> £5 stake x 4/1 x 2/1 = £70 profit + £5 stake</i></p><p>If you have placed a double bet at each-way terms on, for example, two horses, then you will need both horses to win to be paid out the full winnings. However, you will also see some return if both horses place.

It involves picking two selections, each in different races, and then placing two double bets, a win double and place double. The win double needs both horses to win to be successful while the place double needs both horses to place to be successful.&nbsp;</p><p>As you are placing two bets in one, your stake will be doubled, so a £10 stake would double to £20 to cover both the win double and place double. The place double odds are 1/5 of the original odds.&nbsp;</p><p>Here is an example of an each-way double bet if you bet £10 on two horses at 7/4 and 5/1. Your potential winnings would be £192. That’s £165 for the win part, including your stake money as it multiplies, and then £27, including the place stake as that multiplies, for the place part.</p><p>If both horses win, both the win and place parts of the double bet win and you will get £193.75.</p><h4>Win</h4><p>£10 @ 7/4 = £17.50 winnings + £10 stake = £27.50</p><p>£27.50 @ 5/1 = £137.50 winnings + £27.50 stake = <b>£165</b></p><h4>Place</h4><p>£10 @ (7/4 x 1/5) = £3.50 winnings + £10 stake = £13.50</p><p>£3.50 @ (5/1 x 1/5) = £7 winnings + £10 stake = <b>£27</b></p><p>If one horse wins and the other places, you will lose the win part of the bet but your place part will be successful. You will win £27.</p><p>If both horses place, you will lose the win part but your place part will be successful, winning you £27.</p><p>If one or both horses fail to win or place, then you will lose both bets of your double.</p><p>Now you know everything you need to know about single bets, take advantage of the best bookmaker offers on our <a href=#>free bets page</a>.</p><ul><li>Find all of the best <a href=#>free bets</a> to use on this year's Grand National</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbHLnp6rmaCde6S7ja6iaJqVqcGqusZoqqmnoqnAbrPUopueq1%2BstaLAjKKqZpldmby2rsueZJudpGQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
