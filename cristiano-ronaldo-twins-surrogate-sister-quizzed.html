So far, there has been no confirmation from the footballer. But there are rumours that his mother Dolores has travelled to the States to collect the babies; in an official biography published in 2014, Dolores previously confirmed that she had collected the 32-year-old's son Cristiano Jr from a private hospital in Florida after he was born in June 2010.</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=evyqOFomNyvD4 data-wc=81>Meanwhile, there has also been <a class=hm-link href=#>speculation that Cristiano's girlfriend, model Georgina Rodriguez, is expecting a baby</a>, which began when the footballer shared a photo showing him resting his hand on Georgina's stomach. But mother Dolores dismissed the reports. "It's just nonsense," she told Portuguese magazine . "It's just a hand on the belly, and as far as I know, Cristiano will not be a father again. I hope he has more children, he wants to be a father again. Now that Cristiano has money, he can raise more children as well."</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
