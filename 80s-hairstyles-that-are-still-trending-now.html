The era was home to more than a few major <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>hairstyles</a>, and for better or for worse, we are currently living in the midst of a 1980s resurgence.&nbsp;</p><p id=eUjxf2_2MmG data-wc=9>An unexpected <a class=hm-link href=#>beauty</a> comeback if ever we saw one.</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">Don't Miss</h4><p id=e_6mz5QiY4Y data-wc=13><strong>READ:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>Get the look: how to recreate Cindy Crawford's iconic 90s blow dry</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/f76f11916f76-madonna-80s-hair.jpg><p id=e7SThvIP3z data-wc=62>The 1980s aesthetic was bold and eclectic. Acid-bright eyeshadow, brazen New Romantic blush and bright lips were not complete without a statement hairstyle to match - many of which involved larger-than-life volume. You had to be there. Only, nope, you didn't actually have to be there, judging by the number of looks that are bounding back into the beauty sphere right now.</p><p id=erYA6dQYJdY data-wc=32>Fancy a style refresh? Now is as good a time as any to throw it back with a shag Ã  la <a class=hm-link href=#>Kaia Gerber</a> or go heavy on the curls like <a class=hm-link href=#>Gigi Hadid</a>.</p><p id=e-VMDkw5-PlT data-wc=13><strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Hello! Fashion</a> shares the 1980s hairstyles to have on your radar right now:</strong></p><h2><strong>Mullet</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/c048face0571-miley-cyrus-mullet-hair.jpg><p id=eN6gAeD0Pacc data-wc=69>One word: divisive. The mullet is a style practically guaranteed to get tongues wagging. The haircut features super short hair on the sides and top, and longer lengths at the back and was adored by rockstars. <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>Miley Cyrus</a> is one of the modern celebs who has put her own contemporary twist on the iconic style - no doubt her dad, complete with mullet-celebratory smash hit, would very much approve.</p><h3>How to get the look</h3><p id=eiCWHD4Y7O data-wc=71>"You are going to want to be careful with this look because it can go from glam to grave very quick," explains celebrity hair extraordinaire <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Andrew Fitzsimons</a>. "Mullets suit a wide variety of face shapes, and are all about embracing the natural texture of the hair. Applying a texture spray will help your hair obtain that tousled 80s look. Look to Miley Cyrus, or more recently Kristen Stewart, for some inspiration."</p><h2><strong>Curly Bangs</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/410990506d48-zendaya-curly-bangs.jpg><p id=emZx51QmXAy data-wc=63>&nbsp;In the mood to channel one of the decade's most iconic characters? Take curly bangs for a spin and get the Baby Houseman look. You'll have the time of your life. (Sorry.) If you're looking to infuse your hairstyle with some added interest, curly bangs are a great alternative to the classic curtain, wispy and French-girl styles that we all know and love.&nbsp;</p><h3 data-gid=e82fYWVji_>How to get the look</h3><p id=e3etsIJ53sW1 data-wc=112>"Bangs in general have become extremely trendy since the curtain bang trend took over TikTok last year," Andrew says. "Depending on the intensity of the look you desire, you can use a flat iron to curl your bangs down toward your face, to give them beautiful volume, or you can use a small curling iron to curl sections of your bangs into spirals. If you have naturally curly hair, all you'd have to do to get the look is get your bangs cut at a salon. <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>Zendaya</a> has beautiful curly hair and has rocked the curly bangs look before. To help maintain your curls, finish off styling with a dash of hairspray."</p><h2><strong>Crimping</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/bda75737e4fe-gigi-haidid-curly-hair.jpg><p id=eOzwwzMuSD data-wc=61>Zig-zag waves and major volume, crimping was an 80s beauty classic. While a dedicated iron tool can help you achieve a uniform effect, you can bend the rules and blend crimping with larger curls for a feathery effect. Andrew loves the look of crimped hair, praising its ability to "add an amazing amount of volume and texture while still appearing soft".</p><h3 data-gid=e82fYWVji_>How to get the look</h3><p id=eYfCVQ0OO-77 data-wc=81>"I think the secret to ensuring your crimped hair looks as gorgeous as it can be is to use your crimping iron moderately, and to ensure you use a product to make your hair shine," Andrew says. "This will give the hair a smoother appearance, rather than looking like you slept in a ponytail. A high-shine hairspray&nbsp;will add the perfect finishing touch. Look to Tyra Banks, or Gigi Hadid to see how you can make this look work for you."</p><h2><strong>Shag</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/422a3a387d55-kaia-gerber-hair.jpg><p id=ePzXn5ge47 data-wc=52>Created by barber Paul McGregor, the shag is great for amping up the texture and volume of your hair. The unisex style is characterised by long, choppy layers of varying lengths - David Bowie, Jane Fonda, Mick Jagger and Stevie Nicks among other 80s icons were some of the shag's greatest champions.</p><h3 data-gid=e82fYWVji_>How to get the look</h3><p id=eEdcFfMtFbZ2 data-wc=78>"Those with thin hair ought to know that the layers involved with this cut may make your hair less shag-like and more like a mullet," Andrew advises. "The modern take on a shag has focused more on choppiness, texture, and a sexy careless look. I'd recommend styling your shag with a volumising spray to add that extra grit to the hair. If you are curious as to what a shag looks like, look to <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>Kaia Gerber</a> for inspiration."</p><h2><strong>Mega Volume</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/1178fd2c225e-matilda-djerf-hair.jpg><p id=eE9iGDxz8o data-wc=41>"I happen to think mega volume is always in," says Andrew - and we couldn't agree more. Big blowouts and super bouncy locks are having a particular moment on TikTok right now, and we are totally here for the hair drama.</p><h3 data-gid=e82fYWVji_>How to get the look</h3><p id=ewY7kWO3VsdT data-wc=61>"The most important thing about achieving this look is getting your hair cut into long layers with face-framing pieces," Andrew says. "To get the look at home, use a volumising shampoo followed by a blowout with a round brush. Matilda Djerf is an influencer who always has the most perfect voluminous blowout and can give you some inspiration for this look."</p><h2><strong>Perm</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/dc1f02b2897a-mica-arganaraz-curly-hair.jpg><p id=eyBTbz9wQl5R data-wc=50>Sick of poker-straight locks? A 1980s salon staple, the chemical perm is a treatment that transforms straight hair into curls. It works by breaking down hair bonds and resetting them into a new shape. Need to brush up on the subject? Skip to the end of&nbsp;Legally Blonde. You're welcome.</p><h3 data-gid=e82fYWVji_>How to get the look</h3><p id=esowp8Z6Bn6B data-wc=71>"Curly hair and embracing natural curls has been especially trendy lately," Andrew says. "I absolutely love how perms look, but be cautious because they can be damaging to your hair, if not done properly. This is a look you would have to achieve at a salon, but you can manage your tresses at home with a curl mask to lock in moisture, as perms can be quite drying on the hair.</p><p id=eeQKqoURxVrX data-wc=21><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Like this story?<a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;Sign up to our Hello!
