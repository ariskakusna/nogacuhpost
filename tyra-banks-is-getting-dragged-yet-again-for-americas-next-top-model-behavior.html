As detailed in the video, Manning's body was considered "plus-size" by Banks because her body was said to be heavier from the hips down.</p><p dir=ltr>During another clip, Manning was left crying after Banks questioned why she wanted to cover herself from the waist down. Panelist and fellow model Janice Dickinson made it clear from the beginning that she wasn't rooting for her, stating, "America's Next Top Model is not a plus-size model." In a later episode, Dickinson said Manning was too "fat" and "huge" to be modeling while another person insisted she was "too old."</p><p>Unsurprisingly, the vintage clip went viral and many people had something to say about the show's treatment of the contestants. "Were you a child in the early 2000s listening to Tyra Banks call women who were 5'10 and 115lbs plus sized? if so, you may be entitled to financial compensation," one user <a href=#>tweeted</a>. "The 2000s were something else. This woman's body was sickening," another <a href=#>person shared</a>. "Someone please make a ANTM Documentary cause Tyra and her lil friends deserve to get dragged like Hector's corpse," a third <a href=#>user remarked</a>. Banks or anyone associated with "ANTM" has yet to respond.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcm1pa4N1e9OyqZplkpa7rL%2BMoqpmn5Wpwaq6xmabq5mXnLKledieq2aZl5a2r3nFqKlmmZ2av6qvwKxkp52oqXq1u89mpKiclaF6o7HHmq2ip6Jk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
