The trolling reached a new level after Rodney "Lil Rod" Jones Jr.'s claims brought rumors about Diddy's sexuality into play. 50 has even confirmed plans to work on a <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">documentary about the allegations</a>. The drama all began when <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Cassie</a> filed a lawsuit against him, last year, accusing him of subjecting her to a "cycle of abuse, violence, and sex trafficking." The two settled the case just a day after filing. In the months since, several more alleged victims have come forward with stories about Diddy of their own.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-50-cent-trolls-diddy>50 Cent Trolls Diddy</h2></span><p>About The Author</p><p>Cole Blake is currently an Editor at HotNewHipHop based out of Brooklyn, New York.
