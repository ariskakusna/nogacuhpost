<span class=val><time itemprop=datePublished datetime=2024-08-10>August 10, 2024</time></span></div><section class=summary>Yes, you read that correctly. Vince Neil, a grown man who probably put his John Hancock on more bare breasts than you can count, threw a violent hissy fit because a woman didn't want his autograph. Why he ever expected to be noticed by anyone in the 21st century, we'll never truly know. Let us set the scene for you.

This past weekend, the festival returned to Legend Valley in Thornville, Ohio, with what they called “a slightly scaled-down version of the Gathering.” While the entirely outdoor festival may have been smaller, it didn’t look much different than in previous years, given the fact that juggalos (the fans of ICP, who often cosplay as clowns) have been wearing masks long before it was commonplace—albeit of the terrifying clown variety. <a href=../../../../the-gathering-of-the-juggalos-sees-steve-o-chris-hansen-and-a-horde-of-crazy-clowns-take-over-ohio.html>Read More...</a></section></article></main><nav class=paginator><a class=nav-left href=../../../../categories/post/page/434/index.html>&lt; Prev</a>
