"I don't believe that beauty should be painful!"</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She's speaking about style and appearance, specifically – and how the best piece of fashion advice she's ever been given is "to be comfortable" – but it's a mantra that's served her well in all areas of life, allowing her greater focus and, in turn, increased confidence. "You want to wear the clothes, you don't want them to wear you," she explains. "If my feet hurt, or something's digging in, or I'm pulling a dress down, then it affects my confidence... It's much better to be comfortable, to be relaxed, to be confident – then that will shine through."</p><img alt="a woman sitting on a bed" title="Gugu Mbatha-Raw Women of the Year Harper's Bazaar" width=3000 height=2000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gugu-mbatha-raw-landscape-65422b8e099db.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Helena Christensen</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Mbatha-Raw is filming the latest episode of our Life Lessons franchise on the set of her <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/culture/culture-news/a45699036/awards-issue-philanthropist-gugu-mbatha-raw/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="December/January cover shoot" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">December/January cover shoot</a> in London, for which she's just been photographed by the legendary supermodel, Helena Christensen. The two had never met, prior to our shoot – but, as fellow Goodwill Ambassadors for the UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, they had long admired each other from afar.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It's this very work with the UNHCR that led to the actress being crowned <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/woty/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Philanthropist of the Year in our annual awards issue" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Philanthropist of the Year in our annual awards issue</a>, celebrated with a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/fashion/fashion-news/g45774761/2023-women-of-the-year-awards-portrait-studio/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="starry ceremony" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">starry ceremony</a> at London's Claridge's in November.</p><h6 class="css-x7mxm2 e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"It's been incredibly rewarding for me," she says, of her work as a Goodwill Ambassador. "Being able to advocate for refugees; being able to travel, as I've been able to do with the UNHCR, to the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda, Uganda, and meet individuals who are going through the most difficult of circumstances, displaced from their homes and trying to survive in the world – but not just survive, thrive – and be able to share those individuals' stories, has been such a privilege. It's the world we're in and I have the chance to spread awareness. It's been an incredible, eye-opening experience."</p><img alt="a woman in a dress" title="Gugu Mbatha-Raw Women of the Year Harper's Bazaar" width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gugu-mbatha-raw-654229f3bc9c0.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Helena Christensen</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The actress and producer has also learnt the importance of setting boundaries and taking care of herself; knowing when to trust her instincts and how to manage her time.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"For me, self-care means knowing when to say 'no'," she explains. "So often we're in such a people-pleasing culture and if you don't say no to things that your instinct truly doesn't chime with, then you'll end up over-extending yourself – and therefore you're not taking care of yourself. Being able to say no is, I think, a good boundary to have, be that in work or in life. It might sound like a negative thing, because you're saying 'no' to something, but you're actually saying 'yes' to yourself and what you need."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This balanced and measured approach also extends to her concept of success, which Mbatha-Raw says "comes in many forms".</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"There's not just one standard of success, or one form of success," she says, thoughtfully. "You have to define what success means to you, personally. There's success in the eyes of the outside world, but if you feel like you're spread too thin or if one side of your life publicly is going amazingly, but behind the scenes everything's falling apart, is that really success? I think if you are able to uphold elements of a whole life – and a whole life being not just work, but something that has many facets to it – not all of that is out there for public consumption. It's for you to know that you're balancing things for yourself."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Watch our full video with Gugu Mbatha-Raw above, in which she shares what she's learnt about confidence, career, friendship, love and more.</p><h6 class="css-x7mxm2 e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwr9Slq66qlWSwtrjTrqmeZZ6axLR7wG1tanBmaH1ye8aunq5lnZeutbTAZqmar12htqexjKWcrKufo8BuwsidnKhn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
