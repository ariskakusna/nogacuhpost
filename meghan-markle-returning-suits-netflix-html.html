Old fans join with new fans to breathe new life into these classic shows, and that collective enthusiasm is sometimes enough to bring the show back. For example, <a href=#>Deadline</a> reports that Suits (a show which ended in 2019) has been streamed so much recently that it may get a reboot, but executive producer Gene Klein doesn’t think Meghan Markle will make a return now that she has married England’s Prince Harry.</p><p><strong>Suits has found new popularity on <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title=Netflix data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>Netflix</a>, to the point that it could get a revivial series, but the show’s most famous star, Meghan Markle, is unlikely to return.</strong></p><p>Meghan Markle was just one of a very talented cast on Suits, and audiences have been discovering (or rediscovering) just how good this show and its cast really are.</p><p>Now that it is <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title=streaming data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>streaming</a> on Netflix and Peacock, Nielsen data records that the show recently passed 3.1 billion viewing minutes on streaming. Such binge-worthy shows are the lifeblood of streaming platforms, and Klein “wouldn’t be surprised” to get a call in the very near future about rebooting the series in order to capitalize on its resurgence in popularity.</p><p>If you’ve never watched Suits before, the premise is that a legal-minded college dropout with a photographic memory, Mike Ross, teams up with an unconventional hotshot lawyer, Harvey Specter, to win cases on behalf of Specter’s law firm, Pearson Hardman.</p><p>Meghan Markle plays the character Rachel Zane, who forgoes the easy career path of working at her father’s law firm to become a paralegal at Pearson Hardman. When she wasn’t pursuing her legal career, her character was often getting hot and heavy with Mike Ross.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/meghan-markle-suits-900x506.jpg><p>Unfortunately, if some kind of show reboot does happen, Meghan Markle may not be the only actor that doesn’t make a return. Klein pointed out that even at the height of Suits’ popularity, “it was a complicated dance keeping everybody involved, getting all the actors deals done and keeping them involved through the end of the show.” Years later, it’s an open question as to how many of these actors would have the schedule availability to shoot a new show or, for that matter, whether they would be inclined to return to this world of complex legal drama.</p><p><strong>“It was a complicated dance keeping everybody involved, getting all the actors deals done and keeping them involved through the end of the show.”</strong></p>Gene Klein, Suits executive producer<p>And while Klein thinks Meghan Markle (who notably left the show after Season 7 because she married Prince Harry) is unlikely to return, it’s not impossible that she would want to be part of a revival of the show that made her famous. <a href=#>People</a> reports that back in April, Markle signed with the William Morris Endeavor talent agency, signifying that she is more interested in Hollywood life than the Royal Family at this point.</p><p>Additionally, since she and Harry’s Spotify partnership fell through, Markle may be interested in a Suits revival that effectively helps promote her Harry & Meghan docuseries on Netflix.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Meghan Markle and her husband, Prince Harry, have been financially cut-off from the British Monarchy, leading to the pair pursuing entertainment deals.</strong></p><p>On top of that, Prince Harry made no secret of the fact that his father, King Charles, has financially cut him and Meghan Markle off since they stepped back from most royal duties and moved to America (in a move dubbed “Megxit” by her critics).</p><p>This is why the unconventional royal duo has so aggressively pursued media deals with Spotify and <a href=#>Netflix</a>. Because of all of this, we wouldn’t be that surprised if Meghan Markle popped up on an eventual Suits revival, even if it was just for a brief cameo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2illZy1orqMppiro5yaerOx066pp6GenHq0wcitqmamlamzrbXXZ5%2BtpZw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
