Amid all the hype surrounding Super Bowl LVIII, she teased some new music in a pair of commercials. One of them was a hilarious Verizon collaboration, with Beyonce trying to break the internet by trying to pull off crazy stunts. At the end of the advertisement, she said, "Drop the new music." Somewhat separate from that ad, Queen Bey previewed one of her two new singles "TEXAS HOLD 'EM." This is going to be a part of ACT II.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">At the end of that commercial, she revealed the release date. It looks to be March 29 and based on both tracks, it seems we are transitioning. We are going from the undeniable grooves of house and dance to <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">country.</a> Beyonce did drop a single, "MY HOUSE," back in December, but that appears to have no ties to ACT II based on its sound alone. But, how do these songs sound?</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-listen-to-act-ii-singles-16-carriages-amp-texas-hold-em-by-beyonce>Listen To ACT II Singles "16 CARRIAGES" & "TEXAS HOLD 'EM" By Beyonce</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Well, they sound pretty damn good. Beyonce has something cooking for ACT II and it may be one of her most ambitious projects. "TEXAS HOLD 'EM" is more of a hoedown song with animated background vocals and a thumping drum pattern. Contrastingly, "16 CARRIAGES" is a more serious vibe with a grand instrumental. It is a self-reflecting Beyonce who looks at all the difficulties and hard work she has put in to get to where she is now. She embraces her Texan roots in a very tasteful way. Grab your lassos and cowboy hats, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">RENAISSANCE</a> ACT II is going to be a hell of a ride.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">What are your thoughts on <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">these brand-new singles</a>, "16 CARRIAGES" and "TEXAS HOLD 'EM," by Beyonce?
