A piece of paper doesn’t protect anyone. Thankful I am single at this point."</p><p>A third referenced one case and wrote: "I feel for John, but he put Rachel and her family through absolute hell. I'd be terrified to be anywhere near him after that. I can only imagine what would happen if Rachel met someone and moved on."</p><p>Another confessed: "I'm watching #IAmAStalker and it has me scared."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Streaming</h2></p><p>One wailed: "I’m going to have nightmares tonight #IAmAStalker is so scary OMG!" while another added: "Other than that this show induces nightmares."</p><p>Daniel Thompson is one of the main characters of&nbsp;<a href=#>Netflix'</a>s new series,&nbsp;<a href=#>I Am a Stalker</a>.</p><p>Daniel is currently serving a life sentence in&nbsp;<a href=#>Missouri</a>&nbsp;for second-degree murder.</p><p>Prior to this life sentence, Daniel kept going after his wife Angie, despite a restraining order, following the breakdown of their&nbsp;<a href=#>marriage</a>.</p><p>He initially broke into Angie's house after she returned from the&nbsp;<a href=#>domestic violence</a>&nbsp;shelter with their children to steal. He got caught and was convicted of burglary.</p><p>After serving seven years, he began the same pattern of stalking with his new girlfriend and subsequently got probation.</p><p>With the next woman he dated, he went to her home to kill her and also stabbed a man to death.</p><p>Recently, <a href=#>Netflix viewers also turned off show His House</a>, saying it "scared the hell" out of them.</p><p>They also confessed they were <a href=#>"stressed and unable to sleep" </a>after another particular crime series.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/NINTCHDBPICT000807746220.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/NINTCHDBPICT000807746354.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2ispmSEeIWPcm9pZ56awae4yLFkomWRonqiedKtmKWjlad6r7XGoaummaKawHA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
