At least they could hold on that until he starts feeling a little less like he was kicked out of Golden State without his consent. Back when he won the NBA title, <strong>Jordan Poole</strong> was riding the top of a massive wave he thought would never end. But that altercation with one of the team's most respected players was when everything changed in his life. Getting on <strong>Draymond Green's</strong> bad side was the reason he was no longer considered an integral part of the <strong>Golden State Warriors</strong> team. As soon as the team's leadership saw a way to get rid of Poole in order to maintain peace in the dressing room, they took it without hesitation.</p><h2 class=ue-c-article__subheadline>Can Jordan Poole succeed at the Washington Wizards?</h2><p>Let's be real, the <strong>Washington Wizards</strong> can be considered a team under reconstruction right now. They weren't even able to maintain Chris Paul when they traded for him. Instead, they decided to bring Jordan Poole as their biggest wager to make the playoffs this season. Don't get us wrong, we believe Poole has incredible potential and he probably thought he would uncover that in <strong>Golden State</strong>. But this rough change of environment is evidently not what he expected. You can tell this simply by looking at every single picture they took of him and even the video. <strong>Jordan </strong>clearly states he is super excited to be there while displaying the most depressed face you've ever seen.</p><p>Anybody who sees how the entire situation progressed will tell you will tell you Jordan Poole definitely got the short end of the stick. Even people online are already saying stuff like, <strong>Poole </strong>looks like he was just accepted to<strong> 'The Night's Watch' from Game of Thrones</strong>. We are also not saying Poole won't eventually adapt to the Wizards and he probably will have some great nights with his new team. But trying to get him to enjoy the current situation is impossible because everything is still fresh in his memory. Try to take another set of pictures when the season is at least 10 games in. We bet <strong>Jordan Poole</strong> will have an entirely different expression on his face.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RnJhnm5%2BifKa6jpuYrKOVqa%2BiuMtopZuZX6yutLTIp56tp55ixKrGwKubrGdiZX90e49wZmlwX2uBooXAb5lpamZtsnSxkWlrnnCSaYJ6hY2hq6ak</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
