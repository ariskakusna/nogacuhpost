Thursday night's episode appeared to confirm that the pair were done for good, and it looks like Maura wouldn't be against getting to know a newly-single Curtis a little better! Speaking about the professional dancer, she said: "He's obviously gorgeous. He's very manly and I love that. He's funny. He's the whole package for me." Lucie was shocked by her admission, saying: "Wow." Maura added: "There have been so many times where I want him to teach me how to dance… I had a chat with him today in the kitchen. If he wants a shoulder to cry on, I'll be here!"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/aeb550b24c6f-love-island-lucie-z.jpg><p id=eURCBxj8R4j data-wc=95>Curtis and Amy had a chat about their relationship, with Curtis telling her: "It's probably going to be horrible to hear but I do feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders." Amy replied: "That's interesting because last night I was going to end the conversation with giving you a second chance. I was going to work hard on our relationship. I thought that is what you wanted. But that's not what you want." He added: "I don't feel the romantic connection so I don't feel like it'll work in the long run."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/397ba3675092-love-island-amy-z.jpg><p id=eifC64Tq4gfg data-wc=1><strong>READ: <a class=hm-link href=#>Are there still feelings between Love Island's Michael and Amber?</a></strong></p><p id=e2t0U5Ze5QTf data-wc=74>Meanwhile, Ovie revealed that if it doesn't work out with a torn Amber, he'd have his eye on Joanna. Anna is currently torn between him and Jordan, but told Jordan: "I feel like the way you've handled everything has been so good and attractive." He replied: "I just wanted to prove that you can trust me and that I do like you. Maybe I didn’t say it enough before you went to Casa Amor."</p><p id=emaGUA1MUrvF data-wc=1><strong>READ: <a class=hm-link href=#>AJ Pritchard has the BEST reaction to brother Curtis' awkward Love Island chat</a></strong></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
