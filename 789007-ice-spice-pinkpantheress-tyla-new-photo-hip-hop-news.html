Over the weekend she made her debut at Coachella where she dazzled fans with some of the biggest hits from her breakout 2023. Just a few days later she found herself on the other side of the country making a surprise appearance during a PinkPantheress show in New York. The two collaborated on the song "Boys a liar pt. 2" last year which became a breakthrough hit for both of them. They performed the song together and then posed for a picture with yet another recent breakthrough star backstage.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">That star is Tyla, whose song "Water" took hold on the charts late last year and soared to be one of the biggest hits of the last few months of 2023. The song is still holding on currently sitting at number 24. The three recently christened stars found the time to pose for a stunning photo together backstage. The picture made its way to the internet where fans couldn't resist praising all three of them. Numerous fans left comments about them being the real "big 3" in popular music and some even compared them to TLC.
