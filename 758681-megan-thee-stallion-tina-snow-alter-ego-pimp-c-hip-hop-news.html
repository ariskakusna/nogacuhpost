One of her most popular alternative titles is Tina Snow, a name which she shares with her 10-track 2018 EP. Meg's favorite rapper of all time, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Pimp C</a>, is the origin of the nickname, which many fans may not know. In fact, her admiration for the "Int'l Players Anthem" rapper significantly influences much of the Houston native's sound and style, highlighting Pimp C's <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">impact on the genre</a> today. Here's a look into how exactly Megan coined the name Tina Snow, and what the esoteric title means to her brand.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-pimp-c-s-nickname-was-tony-snow>Pimp C's Nickname Was Tony Snow</h2></span><p>HOUSTON - APRIL 3: Rapper Pimp-C of the rap group UGK during the video shoot for the lead off street anthem Pourin Up from Pimp-C's highly anticipated solo album Pimpalation on April 3, 2006 in Houston, Texas.

His inventive use of the title Tony Snow ultimately inspired Meg to gender-swap the nickname to Tina Snow for her own use. Throughout Pimp C's discography, he commonly referred to himself as Tony Snow, often using the nickname as an alter ego to refer to the habit of selling cocaine, or "snow." The motif of selling cocaine also doubles as a metaphor for pushing "dope" music to the masses.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The first name Tony was likely chosen due to a number of popular crime figures throughout both true history and fiction, including Tony Montana and Tony Soprano. As Tony Snow, Pimp C would approach the mic with a cool, laid-back style which inspired Megan from a young age. Once <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">the "Hiss" rapper</a> began pursuing music as a career path, she knew she needed to pay homage to her favorite performer, taking on her own iteration of the Tony Snow name.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-megan-gender-flipped-the-nickname-to-inspire-other-women>Megan Gender-Flipped The Nickname To Inspire Other Women</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">During interviews, Megan Thee Stallion has explained that she picked up the alter ego of Tina Snow both to pay homage to Pimp C and also to inspire other femcees to rap with the cool confident swag often reserved for upper-echelon rappers. Being that she hails from Houston, the same hometown as the legendary UGK rapper, Megan felt that it was her place to carry the torch left behind by Pimp C and inspire a new generation of forward-thinking hip-hop listeners.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">When rapping under the title Tina Snow, Megan Thee Stallion delivers more aggressive and street-wise lyrics in a smooth, laid-back gangster flow. While the character of "Megan" may prioritize higher academic learning and getting good grades, Tina Snow is solely focused on hustling and getting money. Meg even appeared as the character Tina Snow in a 2022 episode of the <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Starz series P-Valley</a>.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-megan-has-several-other-nicknames-and-alter-egos-as-well>Megan Has Several Other Nicknames And Alter Egos As Well</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In addition to her Tina Snow moniker, Megan Thee Stallion has also formed several other nicknames throughout her years behind the mic. Some of her other nicknames are self-explanatory, such as Hot Girl Meg, while others also have deep-rooted backstories like the Tina Snow title. Other common nicknames utilized by the prolific female rapper include Suga, Htown Hottie, and simply Megan.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The Tina Snow name clearly holds a special place in Meg's heart, however, as she uses the title for her social media handles. Ironically, many modern hip-hop heads probably know the Tina Snow title better than they know Pimp C's discography, proving that Megan has propelled the title and sound of Houston to new heights with her massive catalog of hit tracks.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>TeeJay Small is a professional humorist, pop culture columnist, and an avid enjoyer of all things hip hop.
