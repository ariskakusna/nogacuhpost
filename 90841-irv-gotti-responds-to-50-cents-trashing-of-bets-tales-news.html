Throw in the crew from&nbsp;The Breakfast Club and you've got a recipe for making some delicious sound bites that fans and casual music consumers alike will gobble down like the rapper's 2003 lead single from&nbsp;Get Rich or Die Tryin'. Fif touched on a variety of topics, but was chiefly there&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">to promote</a>&nbsp;50 Central, his upcoming project for the BET Network. It turns out his old rival, Irv Gotti, is already at BET, the creator and mastermind behind the popular show&nbsp;Tales. However, just because the series viewers are enjoying it, that doesn't mean 50 Cent thinks it will be around for too much longer.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"They'll be gone, they won't be there gone," he said. "I have full-on intentions to remove [them]. There's some adjustments to be made." When asked to elaborate on what exactly he found to be lacking with&nbsp;Tales, 50 claimed that it was a "cool idea, not well executed." He later confessed that, despite his distaste for the program, he still tunes in to nearly every episode. I guess Fif is more dedicated a hate watcher than previously assumed. Irv later shared a funny response on Instagram, claiming that, even after all that, he should be thanking the rapper/mogul for all of the mentions.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"All bulls**t aside. I WANNA THANK THIS N****," Irv said in the caption to a video clip of the interview he posted on social media. "HE PROMOTE MY S**T BETTER THAN&nbsp;<a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel="nofollow noopener">@bet</a>&nbsp;Hahaha. And it's obvious. YOU LOVE TALES. You just can't say it. Obviously. You say great concept. Poor execution. Hahaha. F**k outta here!!" The producer and former <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Ja Rule</a> backer then went on to give quite the hilarious plug for Tales, which returns in less than two weeks. "Everyone. Right after the Hip Hop Awards on Oct 10th. My enemies favorite show returns. Hahaha. TALES. 10pm [...] Tales is back. And as far as it stopping. The opposite is happening. TALES is expanding. All Music Genres. Pop. Rock. Country. R&B. Gospel. And across the Globe&nbsp;[...] Like you said c**k sucker. It's a dope Concept right??"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdpZYV1fYyiqa9ll6TBtbWMq5ysqJ%2BjsbR506hkbmhdmLKvwNJmq6uZo522r7OMqJ1mmpWpwG7AwKWcrGWemsS0</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
