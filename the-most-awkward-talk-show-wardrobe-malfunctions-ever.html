In the case of Oscar nominee Rosamund Pike, who appeared on "<a href=#>The Tonight Show</a>" in 2017, that included the fabric holding together the black dress she wore for the occasion. It was during "Say Anything," a bizarre word association game that included downing shot glasses of a&nbsp;JÃ¤germeister liqueur and pineapple juice concoction&nbsp;dubbed Surfer On Acid when Pike's garment played havoc with the "Gone Girl" star. "I might have just fallen apart from behind," Pike said as she felt her back become exposed to studio air.&nbsp;"My dress might have split."</p><p>By all accounts, Pike didn't seem to be freaked out over the wardrobe malfunction, even joking that Fallon might be privy to a peep show. Ever the gentleman, Fallon replied,&nbsp;"I won't look. I'm not even wearing pants, so this is good."&nbsp;Those hoping for a public inspection of both celebrities' attire were sadly disappointed when the chat resumed as close to normal as a fashion foul-up would allow.&nbsp;</p><p>This was not Pike's first trip to the wardrobe malfunction rodeo. At the BFI London Film Festival 2016, she told <a href=#>Magic Radio</a> that moments before she was supposed to take the red carpet, her dress broke and had to be stitched up right then and there. Cool girl always keeps her cool.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcm5lbIR0e9OhnGaln6jBbq3WpK6aqpRiwaK4ymaqoaenYsSivsOrppudXaKurbLUp5qtoZ%2BjwG6x1Z6paA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
