The error often arises from a weak or unreliable connection. Conducting a speed test can help assess your internet speed. If the connection is indeed unstable, consider resetting your modem or router. Alternatively, switching from mobile data to a Wi-Fi network may prove beneficial. Ensure the Wi-Fi router is positioned in proximity to your device for an enhanced signal. In cases of persistent slow or absent internet connection, it is advisable to reboot the Wi-Fi router.
