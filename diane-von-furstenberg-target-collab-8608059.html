Its latest, the Diane von Furstenberg for Target Collection, just might be its most ambitious to date. "We celebrated the 25th anniversary of our first designer collaboration this year, and it's the 50th anniversary of the wrap dress," Jill Sando, Target's Executive Vice President and Chief Merchandising Officer, tells InStyle. "It's accessible, celebrates her brand, and celebrates our brand." The legendary Diane von Furstenberg herself agrees.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Everything is about the woman, to make her feel her best, and everything is inspired by nature," said Diane, who worked on the limited-edition line with her granddaughter, Talita von Furstenberg, co-chairwoman of DVF. "It just makes you happy. It makes you smile."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Courtesy of Target</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Diane von Furstenberg for Target Collection is vast, boasting 200 items that range in price from $4 to $100, with most costing under $50. The line spans everything from the designer's iconic wrap dress to children's clothing, yoga mats, press-on nails, activewear, and tablescapes. Each piece features an archival DVF print refreshed for 2024 with updated color palettes, details, and sizes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Imbuing the collection with DVF energy was no small feat. It was Talita who spearheaded bringing the iconic brand's visual DNA, 50 years in the making, to Target's audience. "Talita really ran this project," Diane says. "She could use any coloring she wanted, anything in the archives, and translate it into a whole world."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images, Target</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">What a world she's created. Not only does the collection's sheer range of options ensure shoppers from all walks of life will covet at least one item on their next Target run, Diane and Talita were acutely intentional with each addition, be it a piece of clothing, bedding, or accessory.<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images, Target</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Ritual is part of the DVF vocabulary," Diane says. "Rituals are most important, a part of your routine, a pop of color in this crazy world." As with every topic touched upon in our interview, Talita is utterly aligned with her legendary grandmother's point of view. "We wanted to really give our customer and the world, the most important rituals from morning to bed[time]. We have pajamas, kitchen, home goods for working out and leisure, formalwear. Your whole ecosystem is here, a fun, happy world that's easy."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images, Target</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Each woman's favorite piece from the easy, joyful world they've created is just as diverse as the collection itself. "I'm most excited about the tablescape," says Talita. "We've never done anything like that before and everything is so expensive looking, high-quality, luxurious, and machine-washable."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For Diane, a specific floral-inspired print stands out. "The Ginkgo, I love Ginkgo," she says, adding, "We have a wrap dress in the collection, too, so everyone gets the opportunity to wear their wrap dress and feel the special confidence booster that it has."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images, Target</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In terms of styling the Diane von Furstenberg for Target Collection's dresses, separates, and activewear, which range in size from XXS - 4X the iconic designer has a few ideas, starting with layering on the prints. "The two things that inspire me the most are women and nature and nature is full of mixing prints," she says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Diane also has words of wisdom for anyone who might be hesitant about injecting vivid colors into their wardrobes. "If you're shy with color, it's like being shy with swimming. You just have to throw yourself in the water. Then you'll see how easy and fun it is."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Diane von Furstenberg for Target collection is available in most Target stores and online beginning on&nbsp;March 23.
