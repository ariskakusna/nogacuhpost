However, at a young age, she discovered she's a ripper, prone to losing control when drinking, and even seeing, human blood, making her stronger and emotionally unstable.<h2>Do hope and Josie end up together?</h2>He does not break off the relationship with Josie, however despite the problems and his newfound knowledge. Hope eventually decides not to pursue Landon any more, allowing him to be happy in his relationship with Josie.<h2>Why did hope and Landon break up?</h2>After he stabs Clark (Nick Fink) and eats Cleo, Hope realizes that he's actually Malivore.

Afterwards, he became a librarian and teacher at the Salvatore Boarding School.<h2>Why can't hope and Landon's blood mix?</h2>Landon is also Malivore's son (and a phoenix/human), so it stands to reason that Hope's blood is toxic to him, too. By this logic, the rest of her would probably be pretty unsafe to Landon's health and wellbeing if they got too intimate, meaning the pair can't merge/fuse without risking his life.<h2>Is Landon Malivore in season 3?</h2>'Legacies' Season 3 finale confirms this Landon is Malivore<p>In Legacies Season 3 Episode 16, “Fate's a B—-, Isn't It,” Hope (Danielle Rose Russell) and Clark (Nick Fink) use a locator spell to find the Malivore pit.</p><h2>Why did Rafael leave Legacies?</h2>Rafael left Legacies in season 3 because he was transported to a prison world in order to spare his life.<h2>Does Lizzie have a crush on hope?</h2>Jenny Boyd (Lizzie) loves the relationship between Hope and Lizzie and the journey of accepting Hope into the family.<h2>Does Clarke like Hope?</h2>After Hope saves Clarke, the pair decide they aren't quite friends, but definitely are frenemies who are committed to bringing Malivore down together.<h2>Does Landon get his powers back?</h2>So Landon has resurrected every time he's been killed due to his Phoenix supernatural powers, all up until Legacies S2 Ep15 - When The Necromancer is controlling Raphael and he stabs him with the golden arrow (which is the one thing that can kill a phoenix).<h2>Is Lizzie Saltzman a doppelganger?</h2>There's no proof of her being a doppelganger (yet) who knows if the writers will go there, but they already did that in the vampire diaries, so probably not.
