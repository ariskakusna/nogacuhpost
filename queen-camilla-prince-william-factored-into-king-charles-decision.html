Despite flying approximately 11,000 miles roundtrip from Los Angeles to London and back, Harry only spent <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/royals/prince-harry-reason-for-short-king-charles-visit/><u>about 30 minutes</u></a> with his father at Charles and Camilla’s home in London, as Charles had just started cancer treatment the day before.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ycrPV83tPuThDdGaAMjMzQ-1920-80.jpg><p>“The Queen was with the King,” royal biographer Robert Jobson said, per <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.thesun.co.uk/royals/25828154/camilla-prince-harry-charles-royal/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none><u>The Sun</u></a>. “Let’s be honest—he [Harry] wasn’t too complimentary about Queen Camilla in his book, Spare. He wasn’t very complimentary about her on Netflix [in his Harry & Meghan docuseries]. They don’t get on.” Jobson added, “Second, there’s not been a lot of contact. That brings its own level of complexity and drama which he [the King] doesn’t need at the moment.” The King “gave him [Harry] long enough for a kiss and a hug and wished him all the best,” Jobson said.</p><p>This week marks Harry’s first time back in the U.K. since that quick trip in early February, and royal expert Charlotte Griffiths said on GB News that Charles’ refusal to meet up with Harry was decided after Harry apparently made “certain demands” that couldn’t be met, <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/us-celebrity-news/prince-harry-king-charles-demands-32762356 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none><u>The Mirror</u></a> reports. These “difficult” negotiations seem to surround who could be in the room for the father and son meeting—namely Camilla, who Charles wanted in the room but Harry did not. “We know that Charles likes to meet Harry with Camilla in the room, which isn’t always a popular decision,” Griffiths said. “Harry was without his wife as well, so this was fraught with difficulty.” (Meghan Markle isn’t in the U.K. with Harry, but will meet up with him in Nigeria later on.)&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RCKsoPLGPvVhRcgWMUKaxG-1920-80.jpg><p>Griffiths also suggested on GB News that “other forces” may have driven Charles’ decision about meeting up with Harry, including—you guessed it—<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/prince-william/>Prince William</a>. “William may have had a thought about how this meeting should be conducted or whether it should be conducted at all,” she said.</p><p>A source told Russell Myers, royal editor of <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/us-celebrity-news/prince-harry-uncle-invictus-games-32765211 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none><u>The Mirror</u></a>, that when it comes to William and Harry, “Their relationship remains extremely fractured,” they said. “Harry has privately expressed a wish to sit down with his brother, but now is not the time.” It should be noted that this is Harry’s first visit back to his home country since his sister-in-law, the <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/diana/>Princess of Wales</a>, announced publicly on March 22 that she too had been diagnosed with cancer; there are apparently no plans for the two, once so close, to meet.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/r9NUHE9w45QwTwrP6WMCbE-1920-80.jpg><p>Earlier today, Harry was leaving an event in Central London and was headed for his car when a waiting cameraman asked him “Are you happy to be home?” Because of all of the above and so much more, it was about as loaded a question as it gets, and Harry’s response is telling: per <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.express.co.uk/news/royal/1896899/prince-harry-uk-visit-st-pauls referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none><u>The Daily Express</u></a>, he laughed and quickly replied “Nice to see you” before hopping into the back of his black Range Rover.</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.
