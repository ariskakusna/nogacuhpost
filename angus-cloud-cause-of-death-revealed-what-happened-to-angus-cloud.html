Discovered on the streets of New York, Cloud was an effortless performer who captured the hearts of fans globally. However, the talented young actor’s life was cut short at the age of 25.</p><h2>A Sudden Loss and Its Cause</h2><p>Fans were left in the dark regarding Angus Cloud’s sudden passing on July 31, 2023 in Oakland, California. Recently, however, Alameda County Coroner’s Office released information revealing he died due to accidental overdose of drugs such as fentanyl, cocaine, methamphetamine, and benzodiazepine; said one representative.</p><h2>Family Statement</h2><p>“Today was heartbreaking for all of us at Cloud family as we said goodbye to an incredible human and mourn his funeral last week – especially as his grief over losing his father was immense and caused immense physical symptoms for Angus to suffer tremendously from its aftereffects,” read their joint statement. Angus Cloud will forever remain special to all of them for his creative genius as an artist, friend, brother, son he shared so deeply. We mourn his departure with great sorrow: his loss left a hole that cannot be filled.</p><h2>Euphoria’s Fan-Favorite Fezco</h2><p>Angus Cloud made a name for himself through his role as Fezco, a kind-hearted drug dealer on Euphoria. Created by Sam Levinson and starring Zendaya, the show earned critical acclaim and an Emmy. Fezco became a fan favorite, embodying traits of kindness and complexity that made him more than just a stereotypical character on screen.</p><h2>Legacy and Mental Health Awareness</h2><p>The statement from Cloud’s family also touched upon his struggles with mental health. “Angus was very open about his battles with mental health issues and we hope his passing serves as an early warning signal that they don’t have to struggle alone or suffer in silence,” they stated.</p><h2>An Irreplaceable Loss</h2><p>The news of Angus Cloud’s passing is undeniably a tragic loss for the world of entertainment and his fans. As we mourn the loss of such a promising artist, we are also reminded of the ongoing battle many face with mental health and substance abuse.</p><h2>The Road Ahead: A Conversation Starter?</h2><p>While Angus Cloud’s death will no doubt leave those closest to him reeling with grief, his story should also serve as an important reminder and discussion starter about substance use risks as well as mental health support services.</p><p>Cloud may have lived but short but his legacy will linger long into the future as both an artist and as an advocate for deeper social issues will resonate. His fans wish for continued dialogue about such matters to honor his memory.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbjAp5ylpJmdsrOty51lnKedZIFzfpJomKefpah6pLjOrptmm5GqwKZ5zp9knZ2RqbVuvsSvnJqklZl6uLTArWShmaClsq%2Bxw2arqGWRo7S2v4yco6itlGQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
