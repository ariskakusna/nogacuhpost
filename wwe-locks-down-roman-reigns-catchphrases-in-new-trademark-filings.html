WWE has promoted the matchup as the biggest WrestleMania match in history. It has been obvious for years that Reigns is seen as the top dog in the company.</p><p>WWE recently filed for two new trademarks relating to Reigns. The first is to protect his latest in-ring nickname. Another locks down one of his catchphrases for use on merchandise. WWE also picked up a trademark for the nickname of one of the biggest stars of their women’s division.</p><p>The Roman Reigns-related trademarks are for ” Tribal Chief” and “Acknowledge Me.” Both phrases have been key parts of Roman Reigns’ character for quite some time. Bianca Belair’s ” EST” nickname was also trademarked by the company.</p><p>The listings for “Acknowledge Me” and “EST” were both filed with a description befitting protections for use of the phrases in merchandise. “Tribal Chief” looks more like a standard filing for a wrestler’s name. WWE frequently refers to Roman Reigns as such, so it makes sense.</p><p>You can check out all three trademark filings below. WWE might have some new merch coming fans’ way for WrestleMania weekend. The WWE Universe is always hungry for new designs and things to buy, especially at an event like Mania.</p><p>“Acknowledge Me: Clothing, namely, tops, shirts, jackets, sweatshirts, hoodies; outerwear, namely, coats; bottoms, pants, shorts, underwear, dresses, pajamas, lingerie, clothing ties, scarves, gloves, swimwear; Halloween and masquerade costumes; footwear, namely, shoes, sneakers, slippers, flip flops, boots; headwear, namely, hats, caps; wrist bands; bandanas; championship trophy belts”</p><p>“EST: Clothing, namely, tops, shirts, jackets, sweatshirts, hoodies; outerwear, namely, coats; bottoms, pants, shorts, underwear, dresses, pajamas, lingerie, clothing ties, scarves, gloves, swimwear; Halloween and masquerade costumes; headwear, namely, hats, caps; wrist bands; bandanas; championship trophy belts”</p><p>“Tribal Chief: Entertainment services, namely, wrestling exhibitions and performances by a professional wrestler and entertainer rendered live and through broadcast media including television and radio, and via the internet or commercial online service; providing wrestling news and information via a global computer network; providing information in the fields of sports and entertainment via an online community portal; providing a website in the field of sports entertainment information; fan club services, namely, organizing sporting events in the field of wrestling for wrestling fan club members; organizing social entertainment events for entertainment purposes for wrestling fan club members; providing online newsletters in the fields of sports entertainment; online journals, namely blogs, in the field of sports entertainment”</p><p>WWE has been using all of the phrases regularly on television for quite some time. Securing the trademarks is just a boilerplate step in the intellectual property process. Both Roman Reigns and Bianca Belair expect to make big impacts at WrestleMania in Dallas. They’re probably not thinking too much about trademarks, but WWE has taken the standard proactive steps to protect their creations.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7XNoKqinJWjsri%2FjZympmdiZX9ze49sZmtxX6zEpnnLqJqkq12ZvLi6jKumppmeYr%2BmtcanqmabkamwqbzHq5isnaNitq95zZ6uZqyilrGmucCromaemaG2r7PSaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
