Many fans also wondered whether Bray Wyatt will be making his way to AEW after this release from the company.</p><p>As fans are aware, tattoo artist Kyle A. Scarborough is one of the few people responsible for the creation of The Fiend’s mask.&nbsp;As reported earlier, Bray Wyatt had an <a href=#>insane idea for his Firefly Funhouse characters</a>.</p><p>Kyle A. Scarborough took to Twitter and revealed the original concept of the “burnt Fiend” mask. It featured melted flesh and an exposed skull. The artist stated that he was under the impression that his concept was the one finally used, but that wasn’t what happened in end.</p><p>The “2 hr. deadline Burnt Fiend’ concept. Major rush job, but out of my control. Wanted to show exposed skull & dripping flesh. I was given the impression my concept was used when it wasn’t, but that’s a whole other story for a later time. #TheFiend #BrayWyatt #KultofWindham</p><p>For the record, I liked what was used fine. The mask build was great, though I do think the design was a bit flat. (Design came from their in-house people, apparently). Either way, the blame was placed on Brother Love, so if you liked it, blame him.</p><p>Bray Wyatt’s creative genius was ultimately squandered in WWE according to many fans. Bray Wyatt also recently stated that fans will be seeing him very soon. We will have to wait and see if Wyatt truly will make his way to AEW or not in the future as fans would love to see him there.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p><strong>What’s your take on this story?
