However, if you dash over these, you won’t pick them up.</p><p>When you approach a large patch, slow down to pick them up. A large patch off the beaten path is also worth picking up.</p><p>These don’t give a significant amount, but if they’re on the way, every little helps.</p><h2>Collect the Umbral Tears</h2><p>Each level has <a href=#>three Umbral Tears</a> in it that are difficult to find and collect, but don’t worry, we’ve found them all for you.</p><p>However, if you collect all three, you will open up an alternate chapter that contains a challenge.</p><p>Many of these are boss arenas, or have five-minute time limits, but they give a lot of rewards.</p><p>They are quick to try and redo if you fail, and one of the easiest ways to farm extra cash.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p><br>Written by Georgina Young on behalf of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">GLHF</a>.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">All the latest Gaming tips and tricks</h3></p><img alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/05/Blog-templates-workspace.png><p class=article__content--intro>Looking for tips and tricks across your favourite consoles and games?
