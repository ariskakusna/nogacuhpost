He has sent me for a reason.&nbsp;</p><p>The angel Moroni told Joseph Smith that “God had a work for [him] to do” (<a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0>Joseph Smith—History 1:33</a>),&nbsp;and like Joseph Smith, I have a mission, a purpose and a destiny, and God will help me to discover and fulfill that mission.</p><h3>2. ‘With all my heart, might, mind and strength, I will love God, keep my covenants, and use His priesthood to serve others beginning in my own home.’</h3><p><b>Commitment:</b> When it comes to the gospel, I am “all in.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The Lord has given me everything, and He wants my everything in return.&nbsp; I am beloved of Him, and I love Him.&nbsp; My covenants motivate me to be a light to the world, and my priesthood service — beginning in my own home — can expand into my circle of influence at church, at school and in my community.</p><h3>3. ‘As I strive to serve, exercise faith, repent, and improve each day, I will qualify to receive temple blessings and the enduring joy of the gospel.’</h3><p><b>Focus and fruits</b>: As I practice the first principles of the gospel, I can face the future with confidence, always grateful for the chance to repent and improve.&nbsp;The fruits of the gospel lead me to the most heavenly place on earth, the house of the Lord. The covenant path is a path of joy — the lasting joy that only the gospel can bring.</p><h3>4. ‘I will prepare to become a diligent missionary, loyal husband, and loving father by being a true disciple of Jesus Christ.’</h3><p><b>My work:</b> Important roles and important goals are milestones along the covenant path, and although I cannot know exactly how my life will unfold, I can prepare to become all the Lord wants me to become.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I will prepare not only to go on a mission, but to become a diligent missionary; not only get married, but to become a loyal husband; not only to have a family, but to become a loving father; not only to learn about Jesus Christ, but to become a true disciple of Christ throughout my life.</p><h3>5. ‘I will help prepare the world for the Savior’s return by inviting all to come unto Christ and receive the blessings of His Atonement.’</h3><p><b>His work:</b> As one who holds the Aaronic Priesthood, and a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I have a role to play in the global work of salvation.&nbsp; I will help gather Israel on both sides of the veil that others may find joy in Christ and choose to receive the blessings of His Atonement.</p><h2>Applying the Aaronic Priesthood quorum theme</h2><p>This theme was introduced just before the world pandemic affected our ability to gather.&nbsp;However, pandemic restrictions do not need to stop young men from coming to realize what a blessing it is to know who we are, why we are here, and what God expects them to become.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/deseret.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/cd12ceb/2147483647/strip/true/crop/500x647+0+0/resize/500x647!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fthumbor%2Fjuy3c6RKIg-N83YwMsidH00fjQk%3D%2F0x0%3A500x647%2F500x647%2Ffilters%3Afocal%28250x323%3A251x324%29%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fuploads%2Fchorus_asset%2Ffile%2F23834847%2Fyoung_mens_theme.png"><p><a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0>Young Men General President Steven J.
