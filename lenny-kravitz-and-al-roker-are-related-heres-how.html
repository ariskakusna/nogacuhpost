He honed his knowledge as a part-time weekend weather forecaster at a local station, WTVH-TV while still a sophomore. When he graduated, he became the weekday meteorologist there. Several other gigs followed until he landed at WNBC in New York City in 1983. As the <a href=#>weatherman</a> on the "<a href=#>Today</a>" show," since 1996, Roker became a recognized personality who won two Emmy Awards for his forecasting. He also has hosted a weekend talk show, "The Al Roker Show," since 1995 (via <a href=#>Encyclopedia.com</a>).&nbsp;</p><p>Lenny Kravitz, on the other hand, showed musical talent in his youth, with a natural flair for playing several instruments, per <a href=#>Biography</a>. When his family moved to California, he joined the California Boys Choir and enrolled in a music program at Beverly Hills High School. He later moved to New York, launching his debut album, "Let Love Rule" in 1989. Others like "Mama Said" and "Are You Gonna Go My Way"&nbsp;followed. By 2009, he expanded into acting with a role in "Precious," then "The Hunger Games" and "The Butler."</p><p>Just in case you didn't notice the similarity in the name, the link to Kravitz and Roker is through the musician/actor's mother.&nbsp;That makes these two second cousins, according to&nbsp;<a href=#>Oprah Daily</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCDj3Joa2lfobKvuthmoquZpp7Bu3nAp5tmmZxiv7C3xKtkmqqVYr%2BmuMCtnJ1lmJq%2Fpr%2BMoaawZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
