It [the front yard] was still falling as we were standing there,” she added.</p><p><i><b>Want a streaming service dedicated to news? Flash lets you stream 25+ news channels in 1 place. New to Flash?

I’m hoping we can get back to what it was.”</p><p>Authorities have estimated that the damage from the floods spanning across both Queensland and NSW will cost as much as $2.5 billion when it is all added up.</p><p>Private insurance claims for ruined property such as houses and cars have already reached $936 million.<br></p><span class=title>Read related topics:</span><a class=topic_tag href=# data-tgev-container=story-topic-links data-tgev-label=Sydney data-tgev-order=1 data-tgev-metric=npv data-tgev=event10>Sydney</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7xaKlmqaTmnyzscClZJ6rpJbBpnvSspunnaliu7TDjqywnaaVrnqnuM6om6xlkqHCpnnMqKynrJGeu7R5xZqkoqSpYrSqwsSnZGpoXaK2r8HTnqpmrJ9isrSvwKmcZqCforJurcyim2akkaOxtLjInZxoppWswG6%2F06ipsmdpZ4NyhJZyZ55tYGyBpK2Tm5trm5aWhHl%2Bj2lqcG1paw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
