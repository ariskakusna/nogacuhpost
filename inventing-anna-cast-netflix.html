She also figures out Anna's scam, and gets into a deeper friendship with Rachel. Cox is a four-time Emmy nominee for playing Sophia Burset on Netflix's Orange is the New Black.

Burton had iconic roles in both Grey's Anatomy and Scandal, as Meredith Grey's mother Dr. Ellis Grey and Vice President Sally Langston, respectively. She's also set to star in another scammer series, Hulu's Elizabeth Holmes biopic The Dropout.</p><h2 id=marika-dominczyk-as-talia-mally-3>Marika Dominczyk as Talia Mally</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CRSWSusmgbRgHfGvmsZPY5-1920-80.jpg><p>Talia is another one of Anna's friends who gets caught up in the scam, and is deeply embarrassed after the scammer "borrows" her friend's yacht. Dominczyk played hospital consultant Dr. Eliza Minnick on Grey's, and the TV actress has also appeared on Whiskey Cavalier, Brothers & Sisters, and North Shore.</p><h2 id=anna-deavere-smith-as-maud-3>Anna Deavere Smith as Maud</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dxPbMbCeZFvj98vqeRv7YA-1920-80.jpg><p>Maud is one of Vivian's co-workers in Scriberia, a group of writers mostly forgotten by the rest of the newsroom who all get sucked into the fascinating Anna Delvey story. Smith is an esteemed actress and playwright who portrayed court clerk Tina Krissman alongside Regé-Jean Page in the short-lived Shondaland drama For the People. She's also well-known for playing Bow's mom on Black-ish.</p><h2 id=jeff-perry-as-lou-3>Jeff Perry as Lou</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/p3vqEnxaeMiLrdXpRYBTeF-1920-80.jpg><p>Lou, another supportive member of Scriberia, is played by Shondaland favorite Jeff Perry. The actor portrayed Meredith's estranged father Thatcher on Grey's, and starred in Scandal as the unscrupulous chief-of-staff Cyrus Beene. Perry's so deep in Shondaland, he even acted alongside his real-life daughter Zoe Perry on Scandal season 6, when she played the mysterious villain Samantha.</p><h2 id=anders-holm-as-jack-mercer-3>Anders Holm as Jack Mercer</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KsXKEbw8WDAviVSU7TbXQL-1920-80.jpg><p>Vivian's supportive husband Jack is by her side as she becomes obsessed with her story, even as she covers their nursery walls with story notes.

Succession fans might be delightfully confused at the sight of Roman's girlfriend Tabitha cuddling up to Stewy (though I can see it happening). FitzGerald has also starred on the dramas Station Eleven, Sweetbitter, UnReal, and Masters of Sex (as well as three episodes of the original Gossip Girl).</p><h2 id=rebecca-henderson-as-ada-catherine-mccaw-3>Rebecca Henderson as ADA Catherine McCaw</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VksWMPL2JdpnMi6ui9ccpF-1920-80.jpg><p>The no-nonsense prosecutor on Anna's case is portrayed by Rebecca Henderson.

Malina played David Rosen, the white hat who rose from Assistant U.S. Attorney to Attorney General over the course of the show, and switched between being Olivia Pope's ally and enemy the whole way through.</p><h2 id=debra-mooney-as-the-judge-3>Debra Mooney as the Judge</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MtfshXz7stwVp9bihf8YXQ-1920-80.png><p>The judge in Anna's case is another Shondaland favorite. On Grey's Anatomy, Mooney plays Owen Hunt's no-nonsense mother Evelyn, who has appeared on the show on and off since 2008. She also played Supreme Court Justice Verna Thornton, who was part of Fitz's campaign and helped cover up the Defiance scandal. (Spoiler alert: Fitz suffocated her after finding out about Defiance.)</p><h2 id=ben-rappaport-as-billy-mcfarland-3>Ben Rappaport as Billy McFarland</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/khqZ5B8w9QecJnisqapthF-1920-80.jpg><p>The show's version of Billy McFarland, the man behind the Fyre Festival, is played by Ben Rappaport. The familiar actor starred on For the People as Assistant US Attorney Seth Oliver, a total change from his scammer role. He's also acted on the shows Mr. Robot, Younger, and The Good Wife.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RopycpJGev6Z6wqikaJulocG2vsRoq69lo528uL%2BOoqWvnZ6ptq%2BzjJqlp5ldmK60wIynnK2enJ7FcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
