The late singer’s family consented to the request just before his body was scheduled to be cremated on Friday morning.</p><p align=left>“It has been decided not to cremate the body,” singer <a href=#><strong>Lee Seung-chul</strong></a> told reporters on behalf of Shin’s family outside Seoul Memorial Park’s crematorium. Lee explained that he and fellow K-pop artists convinced the family to consider a postmortem to determine the exact cause of death.</p><p align=left><strong>Read more</strong> <a href=#>K-Pop Star And North Korean Defectors Perform on Korean-Japanese Disputed Territory</a></p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p align=left>“The bereaved family feels as if the world is caving in,” said <a href=#>Psy</a>, who was seen shedding tears during a Catholic memorial service for Shin earlier on Friday morning at Asan Medical Center. The <a href=#>“Gangnam Style”</a> star collaborated with the musician on the 2003 album Project X.</p><p align=left>“The autopsy is irrelevant to whether or not the family decides to file charges [against Seoul Sky Hospital that has been accused of malpractice]. The family does not want this. It is so that we could know why he passed away, irrespective of possible legal disputes,” the rapper added.</p><p align=left>Shin was a pioneer of avant-garde rock music since debuting in 1988. The singer-songwriter formed a band, N.E.X.T. (New Experiment Team), and was widely called “the Devil” for his charismatic stage presence, socially critical lyrics and vocal support for such causes as ending corporal punishment in local schools.</p><p align=left><strong>Read more</strong> <a href=#>LVMH Invests $80 Million in K-Pop Giant Behind Psy</a></p><p align=left>The artist had an operation on Oct. 17 for what has been reported to be a strangulated hernia at Seoul Sky Hospital and was discharged the following day. He was readmitted to the hospital on Oct. 20 and suffered a heart attack two days later. He was in a coma for five days before dying of cardiac arrest on Monday following a bowel operation. He was 46 and is survived by his wife, <strong>Yoon Won-hee</strong>, a broadcaster and columnist, and their 8-year-old daughter and 7-year-old son.</p><p align=left>He released his first studio album in six years this summer and was about to announce more new songs with his band N.E.X.T. Over 16,000 mourners, including top K-pop artists, actors and fans, visited Shin’s mortuary that was set up at Asan Medical Center for three days beginning on Tuesday.</p><p align=left><strong>Oct. 31, 1:09&nbsp;a.m.</strong>&nbsp;Updated with additional details regarding the number of visitors to Shin’s mortuary.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue82erqxnl5q7pr7ApWSnnaeofLG%2F2GamraCVp8BuvNSsn2aZpam8sb%2FYZqJmb2RqgHSCjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
