The series was <a href=#>reincarnated</a> three months later when the studio and Lifetime came to terms on a new, cost-effective financial model for the soapy drama to continue. It went on to earn a 13-episode <a href=#>renewal</a> for a sixth season. During that span, Berman created and ran Fox’s The Mob Doctor, which was <a href=# id=auto-tag_canceled data-tag=canceled>canceled</a> after one season in 2012-13.</p><p>In its fifth season, Drop Dead Diva averaged 1.99 million total viewers, down from season four’s 2.3 million and off considerably from season one’s 2.84 million average.</p><p>During its run, the series has won multiple GLAAD Awards as well as the Gracie Award for Individual Achievement by a female rising star for Elliott. Last month, she was nominated for another GLAAD Award in the individual episodic category. The series has also picked up nominations for Prism Awards, NAACP Image Awards and was a contender for the Humanitas Prize.</p><p><strong><a href=#>PHOTOS: 17 TV Shows Brought Back From the Dead</a></strong></p><p>Cho, meanwhile, has already booked her next gig with a&nbsp;<a href=#>co-starring role</a> in Fox’s <strong>Tina Fey </strong>comedy Cabott College.</p><p>For Lifetime, the decision to end Drop Dead Diva comes five months after the female-skewing cable network opted to <a href=#>cancel</a> its longest-running drama, Army Wives, after seven seasons. The cabler will bow a two-hour retrospective — Army Wives: A Final Salute — on Sunday, March 16 at 9 p.m.</p><p>Meanwhile, the network has already begun ramping up its originals, picking up two new drams to series: <strong>Marti </strong><strong>Noxon</strong>‘s Un-Real and dystopian thriller The Lottery. Those two will join <strong>Marc Cherry</strong>‘s Devious Maids and Witches of East End on the network’s scripted roster. Lifetime currently has one pilot in the mix — <strong>Nicholas Sparks</strong>‘ Deliverance Creek, which will air as a two-hour backdoor pilot. <strong>Alicia Silverstone</strong>-starrer HR will not move forward.</p><p>Email: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Lesley.Goldberg@THR.com</a><br>Twitter: <a href=# rel=nofollow>@Snoodit</a></p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOpaCfnaSeuqa%2FjJ2pqKhdmbKisIydoK%2BZXZq7pXmVcHByb2Nk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
