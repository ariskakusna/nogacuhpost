Following a <a href=#>family tragedy</a> in the 1990s, the singer-songwriter began his career as a <a href=#>songwriter</a> in Nashville, but soon after, became a performer and quickly rose to prominence on the country music scene. After launching his solo singing act, Bryan signed to Capitol Nashville and released his debut album, <a href=#>I'll Stay Me</a>, in 2007.</p><p dir=ltr>Even with the moderate success of his first two albums, Bryan didn't gain mainstream appreciation until the 2010s with the release of his third studio album, Tailgates and Tanlines. That album was number one on the Top Country Albums <a href=#>chart</a> and number two on the Billboard 200 chart. Bryan's hit single from the album, "Country Girl (Shake It for Me)," also peaked on the charts, hitting number four on the <a href=#>country charts</a> and number 22 on Billboard's Hot 100 <a href=#>chart</a>.</p><p dir=ltr>Bryan quickly proved that he was a mainstay for country music and went on to receive accolades. Both the Academy of Country Music Awards and the Country Music Association recognized Bryan as the "Entertainer of the Year" in 2013, and he also received the <a href=#>Album of the Decade</a> award for his 2013 album Crash My Party in 2019. "Winning my first CMA Entertainer of the Year award is something that I'll never forget," Bryan stated in a <a href=#>press release</a>. "You're a member of a club... you left an indelible mark on this industry."</p><h2>'American Idol' is helping Luke Bryan's net worth</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/heres-how-much-luke-bryan-is-actually-worth/american-idol-is-helping-luke-bryans-net-worth-1617816845.jpg> <span class=gallery-image-credit>Jason Kempin/acma2020/Getty Images</span><p dir=ltr><a href=#>Luke Bryan</a>'s net worth is $160 million, according to <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>. Most of that moola is attributed to Bryan's album and record sales along with some producing and songwriting credits for other artists, including <a href=#>Billy Currington</a> and <a href=#>Travis Tritt</a>. One aspect of Bryan's life that's upping his income and therefore his net worth is his recent judging gig on the revamped American Idol.</p><p dir=ltr>Bryan joined pop diva Katy Perry and music legend Lionel Richie to judge the music career show in 2018. At the start of the show, Bryan was the second highest-paid on the judging panel, earning $12 million each season, reported <a href=#>The Wall Street Journal</a>. Add in Bryan's endorsement deal with undergarment brand <a href=#>Jockey</a>&nbsp;– he's done two commercials for them, even starring in one with his <a href=#>wife</a>&nbsp;– and it's easy to see how the country singer's net worth is nearing $200 million. Bryan seems to make smart career moves and ensures that he's paid for them.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbG9ma35ze8eeqZ6rXZ28uHnMrpqhZZyquKZ5wauwmqZdnsBurcKtrJqknK56uLvRrZ9o</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
