The young star's early life saw her star in several TV commercial campaigns, plus in the soap opera , before she landed her breakout film role in Disney's absolutely beloved<strong>&nbsp;</strong>remake of directed by rom-com queen Nancy Meyers, in 1998.</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">Don't miss</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Lindsay Lohan's baby will have alternate living situation far different from famous mom's upbringing" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/ad6503d09258-gettyimages-542344428.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Lindsay Lohan's baby will have alternate living situation far different from famous mom's upbringing" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Lindsay Lohan's baby will have alternate living situation far different from famous mom's upbringing</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/43680953ad45-lindsay-lohan-story-2.jpg><p id=enRWkL0RqNPh data-wc=91>Immediately loved for her naturalistic acting talent and charismatic onscreen personality — not to mention that trademark red hair and freckles — the then 12-year-old was later cast <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>alongside Jamie Lee Curtis</a></strong> in another hugely successful remake, the mother-daughter body switch film<strong>&nbsp;</strong> at the age of 16.

Several reports were published about her being lost in an excessive party lifestyle, and individuals who worked with the young star at the time such as studio executive James G.

At the same time, the previous box office hit winner's films began to fail at the box office and win her less than rave reviews, all of which didn't appear to help her already troubled state.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/c3242004a6ac-lindsay-lohan-story-4.jpg><p id=e85Qs1RfHbsp data-wc=63>From 2007 onwards, Lindsay began to gain a reputation for the many occasions in which she was arrested for offenses including suspicion of driving under the influence and the possession of drugs. But in 2012, despite the fact that most of the public and press' narrative had turned against Lindsay, she showed strength as she began to emerge out of her low period.</p><h2><strong>Beating the bad habits</strong></h2><p id=eTj7OL0hITt1 data-wc=85>In 2013 and 2014, Lindsay Lohan took on many projects in both film and television as well as her first ever West End role in as she tried to reconstruct her image on the worldwide stage as a serious actress.

Speaking with <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Vogue</a> in 2022, the actress revealed that the move to Dubai had allowed her to make a fresh start, and that the location was very helpful for her journey.

In 2021, her image was strengthened yet again by her successfully signing on as <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>the lead in Netflix's Christmas romcom</a></strong> Falling for Christmas, and the later news that she would be starring in two more romcoms for the platform in the not-too-distant future.</p><h2><strong>Happy family life</strong></h2><p id=ej0tYSlEI0 data-wc=50>On April 3, 2022, Lindsay Lohan <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>married her boyfriend</a></strong> of three years Bader Shammas during a private ceremony.
