The former St. Louis Rams star went viral after a video showing him throwing Evans into a television and punching her surfaced online. The violent altercation reportedly occurred in their home in front of their then-five-month-old son. The incident happened in 2021, but only recently was it revealed that Stacy received a <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">six-month sentence in jail.</a></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Following the news, Evans took to her Instagram to share thoughts about the scandal. These days, she explains why she would rather have Stacy undergo a different punishment than being incarcerated. "Jail does not offer resources needed for mental health patients. It is not rehabilitative," Evans wrote in a caption to a video. "The jail and prison system is a punishment in an authoritarian society made to oppress."</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-kristin-evans-explains-her-position>Kristin Evans Explains Her Position</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"I didn’t advocate for jail because the lack of resources, the lack of rehabilitation, the lack of <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">education for mental health</a>," she continued. "And the psychological effect it may have on our son, having already developed a relationship with his father." It seems Evans believes Stacy is a good father, and she would like to keep that bond intact. "Our son consistently FaceTimed his dad several times a week, he spends the entire weekend every other weekend, and he deserves to have that."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Evans predicted that a message such as this would earn pushback. "Please give me some grace in understanding that I’m not being easy on Zac, rather I am trying to protect our son from anymore trauma. Nothing is black and white and not every abuser is the same."</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10">Kristin Wants People To Let Stacy Get Better</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In her video, Evans detailed why she decided to release the video of the abuse in the first place. However, she believes that people can get better, and she wants Zac Stacy to be able to do that. "Especially with a diagnosable mental illness and significant head trauma caused by Football," she added. Stacy hasn't released a statement about the sentencing.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Erika Marie is a seasoned journalist, editor, and ghostwriter who works predominantly in the fields of music, spirituality, mental health advocacy, and social activism.
