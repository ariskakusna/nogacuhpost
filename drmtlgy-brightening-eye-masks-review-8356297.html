But for the other, more unfortunate souls such as myself, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>dark under-eye circles are inherited</a>. Since I was a child, darkness has haunted my eye hollows, which get even darker and puffier if I’m sleep-deprived. I have used expensive eye creams and concealers, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>under-eye masks</a>, and even tried under-eye filler. Some of it works, most of it doesn’t. One of the most effective products I’ve found? The <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Drmtlgy Brightening Eye Masks</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I first discovered the game-changing product while falling down the rabbit hole of social media. It seemed like every time I went onto Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok, I was treated to video testimonials of raccoon-eyed women placing the pink, serum-soaked masks under their eyes. And magically, all their puffiness and darkness was gone 15 minutes later.&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Look —&nbsp;I’m not totally naive. I know many of the influencer-posted beauty videos are too good to be true. However, when I went onto the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Drmtlgy’s website</a>, I found some more convincing evidence in the form of before-and-after photos, lots of positive reviews, and of course, an impressive ingredient list. The masks are made with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>caffeine</a>, which depuffs the eyes, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>niacinamide</a> to brighten the appearance of the dark circles, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>hyaluronic acid</a> for hydration and fine line-reduction, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=5 rel="nofollow nocaes">aloe leaf extract</a> to calm and soothe.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The masks come in a pack of 60, nestled in a plastic jar with a tiny spatula enclosed to help you separate them without using your fingers. Since they’re soaked in serum and have a gel texture, they tend to be a bit slippery, so I try not to walk around too much when I have them on;&nbsp; I usually put them on before getting into the bath so I can lay back and relax for 15 minutes and let the ingredients do their work.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The first time I used them I was startled by the difference they made. I hadn’t slept much the night before and was left with seriously dark circles and puffiness — nothing that even my trusty <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Clé de Peau concealer</a> could hide. My eyes emerged from the masks refreshed, hydrated, and feeling really good, as well; they have a cooling effect, especially if you keep them stored in the refrigerator.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Of course, I’m not the only one obsessed with <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Drmtlgy Brightening Eye Masks</a>. 4,000 people have purchased them at Amazon over the last month according to the retailer, and videos featuring the product have <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nocaes>7.5 million views on TikTok</a>. Plus, shoppers of all ages rave about them on Drmtlgy’s site. “Can't tell you what a difference these make on my 70-year-old eyes, especially during allergy season,” wrote one customer. “I keep them in the fridge and the cold on my eyes in the morning feels so good.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Another shopper in their 40s to 50s wrote that they tried “many eye products similar to this but never noticed a difference.” “These actually brighten the under-eye area and make my eye bags smaller.” They added that they purposely stopped using them for a bit to see if she noticed any difference, and she could “tell right away.”&nbsp; “I love these,” gushed another fan in their 30s. “When I take them off, my under-eye lines are completely gone and moisturized and so bright!”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Put <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Drmtlgy’s Brightening Eye Masks</a> to the test for yourself for $44 at Amazon.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57w6ukraSXrnqjvsign62dnp67qHnEspxmpZGouLR50Z6top2nYoV0gZVrcHA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
