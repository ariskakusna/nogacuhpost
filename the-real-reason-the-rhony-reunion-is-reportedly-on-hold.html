Ratings have plummeted to a <a href=#>record-breaking low of 764,000 viewers</a> and taping has apparently been put on hold. The Season 13 reunion was supposed to be taped in early August, but filming may only start in September. Reportedly, Season 14 of "RHONY" also won't begin filming until early 2022. Traditionally, the show is filmed in the fall and winter, but it seems as if production has been delayed. But what has brought on the sudden decline in ratings?</p><p><a href=#>Page Six</a> reports that viewers are struggling to connect with Leah McSweeney and Eboni. K. Williams, in particular. As one fan <a href=#>tweeted</a>, "Leah and Eboni are not a good fit for this show. #Rhony used to be my favorite franchise. Now all they do is bickering and talking about race." Another was particularly blunt and <a href=#>wrote</a>, "@BravoTV you want to know who brought ratings down #RHONY Leah and Eboni they are the worst!"</p><p>Eboni has been particularly vocal about race this season and has made it her mission to educate her fellow housewives. She told&nbsp;<a href=#>TMZ</a>&nbsp;that she felt demonized by her castmates and that the ratings had nothing to do with her narrative. Eboni claimed if the housewives weren't micro-aggressive during shoots, there would be fewer race discussions. Seems as if "RHONY" may need a hero to save the sinking show.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbW5iaIV4e9OhnGaqlZa5br7Emqqopl2ptaZ50aGmp7Fdp7K2usiopWaho2K%2FprzOq6uenJyuerC6jKGmpZxf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
