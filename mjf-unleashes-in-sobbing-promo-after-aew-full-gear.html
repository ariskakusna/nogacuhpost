Surprises were anticipated, as even the main event shifted at the start of the show. Many noteworthy moments occurred, and fans should have expected nothing less from Tony Khan’s company.</p><p><a href=#>Ringside News had comprehensive coverage</a> of AEW Full Gear, highlighting the event’s significance and numerous talking points.</p><p>After AEW Full Gear, MJF was fresh off of his emotional AEW World Title defense against Jay White. He didn’t hold back as he entered the media scrum as a sobbing mess.</p><p>The Salt of the Earth spoke about how much he loves pro wrestling. He was emotional, and also not holding back the profanities. This was obviously a very raw moment for MJF after the AEW pay-per-view.</p><p>MJF cried about how he “busted my ass” against Jay White, because he wanted his title back. He went through all the pain and carried on with his match, because he loves pro wrestling that much.</p><p>“I busted my ass to make it to the top of this f*cking sport, and when that table broke, I had two f*cking options. I could have thrown him in the ring like an absolute f*cking nerd, or I could have f*cking done what I set out to do and put on a show for the fans that I love. These tears are not f*cking fake. Like it really hurts bad, and I landed on it really hard off the top rope, but I f*cking love wrestling so much, and I love this belt so much, and I love my best friend, Adam Cole, so much, and he helped me get through it, and I’m in a lot of f*cking pain.”</p><p>MJF was able to calm down after that. He ate a pickle, and he took a few questions before leaving. All the while, his body was in pain, recuperating from the battle he just endured.</p><p>We will have to see what the bidding war of 2024 brings for MJF’s next contract. It is impossible to deny that he gave his all at AEW Full Gear, and that performance at the media scrum after the show was Oscar-worthy as well.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>What’s your take on MJF’s performance at AEW Full Gear?
