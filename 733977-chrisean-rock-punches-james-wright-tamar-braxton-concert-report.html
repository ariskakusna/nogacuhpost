When she's not feuding with Blueface, the new mother has seemingly taken to unleashing her anger on others who are prohibiting her from getting what she wants at that moment. On Friday (November 10) evening, reports of physical violence between Rock and James Wright began circulating on various blogs. According to insiders, <a href=# class=text-word rel>Tamar Braxton</a> brought the 23-year-old to appear at her <a href=# rel>live show</a> as a guest performer last night. When it was time for her to go on, she was unreachable.</p><p>As a result, showrunners had no choice but to skip over Rock's track and move on to Braxton's next guest. According to @theneighborhoodtalk, the Baltimore native was out front attempting to get her friend inside the venue when she missed her cue. Chrisean apparently went backstage to seek out more answers, and upon entering Tamar's dressing room, she spoke with Wright. In the middle of the man's explanation, the reality starlet allegedly punched him in the face several times as she was under the impression he was lying to her.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <strong><a href=# rel>Tamar Braxton Rips Microphone Away From Fan: “I Know You Lying”</a></strong></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-tamar-braxton-s-friend-allegedly-punched-by-chrisean-rock>Tamar Braxton's Friend Allegedly Punched By Chrisean Rock</h2></span><p>The Braxton Family Values cast member was reportedly in the room at the time, and police came to the scene.
