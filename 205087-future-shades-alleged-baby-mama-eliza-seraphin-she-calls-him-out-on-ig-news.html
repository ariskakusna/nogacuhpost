An Instagram model named Eliza&nbsp;Seraphin has made claims that Future is the father of her child. While the rapper hasn't spoken publicly about the controversy, he did take to his Instagram Story to share a brief message that may have been directed at Eliza.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">When Eliza caught wind of the IG Story, she took to her page to share a few shots of her own. "At the end of the day, I kept quiet for months. I kept quiet. Nobody heard a f*cking thing. Like, I'm human. He's human.&nbsp;[Cindy's] human," she said. "We're not gonna take away from him...What my thing is and what the point I'm trying to make is: I don't give a f*ck who the f*ck you are. At the end of the day, take care of your responsibility."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Future is rumored to have fathered not only Eliza's daughter, but another woman named Cindy's baby boy, as well. Cindy, too, has suggested that Future has not stepped in to help her with her child.
