The Big Little Lies actress, 56, attended the Planet Omega Opening at Chelsea Factory in New York City last night wearing a simple black evening dress that really packed a punch.</p><p id=eqFJCc0pL4J data-wc=76>Nicole's dress appeared to be made from a heavy velvet fabric and featured a Bardot-style neckline and a bow tie at the decolletage. It swept down in a fitted bodice and bunched at the waist before falling into a long trailing skirt with a deep thigh-split. The Nine Perfect Strangers star elegantly held the skirt in her hand to reveal her legs in a pair of black stockings and simple yet chic black pointed-toe kitten heels.</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Keith Urban brings out Nicole Kidman for surprise Las Vegas appearance</figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/9f960a019e2c-nicole-kidman-speaks-omega-event.jpg><p id=euybLguFbd data-wc=52>As always, Nicole created an understated yet completely stylish statement with minimal jewellery – she opted for a pair of diamante-encrusted rose gold huggy hoop earrings, a watch in the same metallic hue, and her impressive diamond engagement ring – the star is married to country music legend <a class=hm-link href=#>Keith Urban</a> after all.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8fb3d33781a1-nicole-kidman-slinky-black-dress.jpg><p id=exCQLsLtanT data-wc=72>Her hair and makeup were similarly understated and yet totally glamorous. The Blossom Films founder wore a warm brown smokey eye which was swept upwards towards her temples for a sultry cat eye effect and a rosy nude lip with a hint of gloss. Her incredible cheekbones were accentuated with a structured contour and her hair was in an updo with a quirky knot detail and side part which oozed Hollywood glamour.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/6614019a838b-nicole-kidman-black-stockings.jpg><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/5e57cd73e135-nicole-kidman-omega-event.jpg><p id=eHO8MUxgu6E data-wc=52>This is the second LBD Nicole has wowed in this week. <a class=hm-link href=#>The star accompanied her husband</a> Keith, also 56, at the annual CMA Awards at Bridgestone Arena in Tennessee earlier this week wearing a floor-length slim-fit black dress with a plunging V-neck and cut-out torso area connected with a metallic triangle detail.</p><p id=eucrBVueEiG data-wc=37>She wore her strawberry blonde locks down and trailing over her shoulders on this occasion for a softer look but added edgy finishing touches in the form of a diamante-encrusted choker and smokey fox eye makeup look.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/dcfef21ebc27-nicole-kidman-black-dress-cma-awards.jpg><p id=epmoY859_w data-wc=52>Earlier this month HELLO! gained an insight into <a class=hm-link href=#>Nicole's age-defying beauty secrets</a>. Dr. Omar Tillo plastic surgeon at <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>CREO clinic</a> offered his verdict on how Nicole has maintained her youthful glow saying "Nicole’s youthful appearance likely benefits from a combination of a dedicated skincare routine, aesthetic treatments, and possibly even surgical procedures.</p><p id=emAn3VuIPq data-wc=51>"It's likely that Nicole also adopts a healthy lifestyle and balanced diet which reflects in her glowing skin and radiant complexion," he concluded. The Roar star has previously told Vogue that she starts every day with a run and a bone-dry cappuccino – that's a cappuccino with foam, no steamed milk.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2b85c38bd45c-nicole-kidman-black-blazer.jpg><p id=eIaQGTcOfz data-wc=73>When Nicole isn't upping the style stakes in endless black dresses, she takes a more casual approach. The Special Ops: Lioness star <a class=hm-link href=#>attended the South By Southwest (SXSW) event</a>, a prestigious creative arts festival, wearing a boxy black blazer with satin lapels and a pair of white skinny jeans. Of course, glamour is never very far away for the Hollywood powerhouse, so Nicole paired her jeans with a pair of chic black stilettos.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/5ab7d8c36bba-nicole-kidman-feathers-gloves.jpg><p id=eNeoRtS-9Ru data-wc=52>Prior to that she opted for a totally different look. The actress debuted a duck-egg blue dress covered in shaggy tulle which almost looked like feathers. The dress was a mini length and featured a bow tied around her middle. An unusual accessory, a pair of full-length black gloves, finished the look.</p><p id=eknrebCiXT data-wc=15><strong>DISCOVER:&nbsp;</strong> <a class=hm-link href=#>Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban set for celebratory week with daughters Sunday and Faith</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c3db93542368-nicole-keith.jpg><p id=e-H6fFwdBZ data-wc=60>Nicole's family life has also gained time in the spotlight of late. <a class=hm-link href=#>She made a surprise onstage appearance</a> at her husband's concert towards the end of his debut Vegas residency.
