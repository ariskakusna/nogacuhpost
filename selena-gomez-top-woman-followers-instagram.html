Meanwhile, Jenner remains close behind with 382 million and soccer player Cristiano Ronaldo is holding onto his top spot with 563 million followers.&nbsp;</p><p>While Selena Gomez is clearly grateful to her supportive fans, she has been outspoken about the toll social media and cruel body-shaming comments have had on her <a href=#>mental health</a>. “My weight would constantly fluctuate because I would be on certain medications. And obviously, people just ran with it," Gomez said during <a data-offer-url="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=100097X1555749&isjs=1&jv=15.3.0-stackpath&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.glamour.com%2Fstory%2Fselena-gomez-calls-francia-raisa-her-best-friend&url=https%3A%2F%2Ftv.apple.com%2Fus%2Fepisode%2Fselena-gomez%2Fumc.cmc.jt6kk6h9hqtkvkvvh684c4cm&xs=1&xtz=420&xuuid=775b01bc6100996fdb92614baef2d72c&xcust=xid%3Afr1679258216170dcf&xjsf=other_click__contextmenu%20%5B2%5D" class=external-link data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=100097X1555749&isjs=1&jv=15.3.0-stackpath&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.glamour.com%2Fstory%2Fselena-gomez-calls-francia-raisa-her-best-friend&url=https%3A%2F%2Ftv.apple.com%2Fus%2Fepisode%2Fselena-gomez%2Fumc.cmc.jt6kk6h9hqtkvkvvh684c4cm&xs=1&xtz=420&xuuid=775b01bc6100996fdb92614baef2d72c&xcust=xid%3Afr1679258216170dcf&xjsf=other_click__contextmenu%20%5B2%5D"}' href=# rel=noopener>her recent appearance</a> on the Apple TV+ docuseries, Dear… "It was like they couldn't wait to find a thing to bring me down. I was being shamed for gaining weight <a href=#>because of my lupus</a>.”</p><p>She continued, “I lied. I would go online and I would post a picture of myself and I would say, 'It doesn't matter. I'm not accepting what you're saying.’ All the while being in the room posting and crying my eyes out because nobody deserves to hear those things.”</p><p>“Though I was posting these things saying it doesn't bother me, because I didn't want it to bother other people who are experiencing the same thing, getting shamed for what they look like, who they are, who they love… I just think it's so unfair,” she said. “I don't think that anybody deserves to feel less than.”</p><p>In mid February, the <a href=#>Only Murders in the Building</a> star discussed her social media presence with <a href=#>Vanity Fair</a>, confirming that her Instagram is still managed by her assistant and <a href=#>TikTok</a> is the only app she had on her phone (though she later announced she was stepping back from the app after all that Hailey Bieber drama).&nbsp;</p><p>“I went through a hard time in a breakup and I didn’t want to see any of the [feedback]—not necessarily about the relationship, but the opinions of me versus [someone] else,” she told VF. “There’d be thousands of really nice comments, but my mind goes straight to the mean one.”</p><p>Gomez continued, “People can call me ugly or stupid and I’m like, ‘whatever’. But these people get detailed. They write paragraphs that are so specific and mean. I would constantly be crying. I constantly had <a href=#>anxiety</a>… I couldn’t do it anymore. It was a waste of my time.”</p><p>Still, Gomez told Vanity Fair that she loves connecting with fans online and hearing their stories.
