Its readership has fallen to 0.01 per cent of the population over 14, while <i>People’s</i> has dropped to 0.02 per cent.</p><p>A Bauer Media spokeswoman told <a class=body-link href=#>Guardian Australia</a> discussions to close the magazines had been taking place “as the magazines have lost ranging (visibility), which has affected their commercial viability”.</p><p>“As closures impact a number of people, including some staff and suppliers, they need to be well considered and timed appropriately,” the spokeswoman said.</p><p>“The magazines will be closing at the end of the year and we’re working closely with staff to find suitable redeployment.”</p><p>The Twitter accounts for the two magazines were shut down on Tuesday after Guardian Australia approached Bauer for comment.</p><p>The magazines are still being sold at other convenience stores, as well as Coles and newsagencies.</p><p>But Collective Shout has set its sights on the supermarket giant next.</p><p>“The display and sale of pornographic magazines in the public space creates a hostile environment for women and girls,” campaigns manager Melinda Liszewski said in a statement.</p><p>“Sexual objectification and sexism creates a culture of violence against women.</p><p>“We urge other retailers selling these magazines — such as Coles Express — to follow the example set by 7-Eleven and BP and cease the sale of ‘unrestricted’ pornographic magazines immediately.”</p><p>7-Eleven recently stopped selling the magazines in its 700 convenience stores.</p><p>Collective Shout campaigns against the objectification of women and the sexualisation of girls and has been campaigning against the magazines and other titles for a decade.</p><p>It said it ran a successful campaign against ‘lads mag’ <i>Zoo</i> — another Bauer title — four years ago.</p><p>“Bauer has recognised that society has moved on,” Melinda Tankard Reist said, also of Collective Shout.&nbsp;</p><p>“These sexist titles cannot coexist in a society that claims to care about sexual harassment and other forms of mistreatment of women.</p><p>“The <a class=body-link href=# data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=8d15cd48a807e6bb2a93871707fd47ff data-tgev-label=national data-tgev-metric=ev>sexist behaviour of the St Kevin’s students just this week</a> is a reflection of boys’ conditioning by a pornified culture. They learn early that women exist for their gratification. We can’t change behaviour without addressing the cultural normalising of it. A sexist culture grooms sexist boys.</p><p>“All the women and girls we represent thank Bauer Media for demonstrating corporate social responsibility. May other companies follow their lead.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7xaKlmqaTmnyjwdKipZ6ro2S6prDImmapnZ%2BluaZ5wKebZqiZmMG2vsRmpJqfka%2B2r7HSZquoZZOhvLSxjJqrZqyYmnqmusNmpp9lpJ2ybsXEmqloppWswG6%2F06ipsmdlaYVzscVybZtsZZqDo4SWap1unWOXs3R9wJ%2BcmmyUmQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
