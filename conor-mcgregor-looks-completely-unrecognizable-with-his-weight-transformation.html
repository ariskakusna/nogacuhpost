The much-lauded MMA fighter, pictured here in July and December 2021, has been recovering and rebuilding since suffering a <a href=#>devastating leg injury</a> in his last fight, a loss against Dustin "The Diamond" Poirier at July's UFC 264. Now, five months later, McGregor has taken to Instagram to show off his new physique — and he looks incredible, to say the least.</p><p dir=ltr>Taking to Instagram, McGregor showed off his new physique in <a href=#>November</a>, telling all comers to "Bring. It. On." Since then, he has uploaded several other pictures showing off his <a href=#>swole gains</a> and, on December 2nd, <a href=#>shared a pic</a> of him looking lean and mean. And judging by his <a href=#>December 7th post</a>, McGregor has definitely been eating good.</p><p>As of now, McGregor is said to be "190lbs of granite" per <a href=#>Men's Health</a>. The fighter's coach John Kavanagh revealed, ​​"He's doing a lot of strength training at the moment" and added, "The guy is jacked. I think he's coming back as a middleweight" — which, If so, will have McGregor fighting between <a href=#>170 to 185 pounds</a>. "[H]e'll be back on the mats with me now shortly and we'll start off with combat sports training again," Kavanagh continued.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcGhlZYVze8KopaiqXaKwqL7EoKarZZykvKy%2FjJympqicmsGmuNhmrKeqlZi8qLrIs5ibpJVixKrAx2afoqtdrLKqs8etZK2qkaPAp7vRppitoZ%2BjfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
