Simmons was motivated to get into shape after watching himself on "Oz." Simmons told <a href=#>Business Insider</a>&nbsp;in 2016 that his role as Vern, the neo-Nazi leader, pushed him to improve his health. Simmons said, "I was not in good shape at all. I was overweight and soft and here I am playing the head of the Aryan Brotherhood in this maximum-security prison in the first-ever HBO original drama and I was watching the first season when it came out and I just thought, 'Wow, I don't believe this guy at all. I have to get my a** to the gym and be a believable hard-a**.'"&nbsp;</p><p>After losing 40 pounds and getting back into shape for "Oz," Simmons kept up his dedication to fitness.

He wasn't kidding!</p><p>Simmons broke the internet in 2016 after his trainer Aaron Williamson posted photos of the "Whiplash" star on <a href=#>Instagram</a> with the caption, "Every time we train together, I forget he's 61 years old.

It was high praise coming from Williamson, the ex-Marine celebrity trainer behind the "Revenge Body" workout and&nbsp;<a href=#>Khloe Kardashian's incredible transformation.</a> According to <a href=#>Daily Mail,</a> Williamson's clients include Zac Efron, Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson, Sylvester Stallone, and Jamie Foxx. <a href=#>Men's Health</a> reported that Simmons calls the famous photos "shredded Santa" because he was sporting a gray beard while doing bicep curls (seen above).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcGtgZ4Z0e9OhnGaqlZa5br7Emqqopl2fuG6%2FyKakqKajYrCwuc%2BlnK2dnK56tb7Ap6qfp6KisqV5x6KqZpmgpbKivsCnmp5n</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
