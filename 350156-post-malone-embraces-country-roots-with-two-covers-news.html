Given the focal point of the event, Post opted to shy away from some of his more hip-hop-inspired sounds, instead embracing his country roots with a pair of classic covers.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Following a video message from the legendary Stone Cold Steve Austin, Post Malone closed out the show with a laid-back take on Brad Paisley's 2002 jam "I’m Gonna Miss Her (The Fishin’ Song)", followed by&nbsp;Sturgill Simpson’s "You Can Have The Crown." While it might not be the Posty you know and love, it's still nice to see him embracing the spirit of the event, representing his childhood home of Texas with guitar in hand. Check out the two-song set from Post Malone at the&nbsp;02:04:15 mark, and show some love to his versatility in the comments below.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p>About The Author</p><p>&lt;b>Feature Editor&lt;/b> &lt;!--BR--> Mitch Findlay is a writer and hip-hop journalist based in Montreal.
