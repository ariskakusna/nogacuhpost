Did you know it contains around 750,000 words? That’s a lot of reading! And if you’ve ever wondered how long it takes to read the whole thing, we’ve got an answer for you. But today, our journey into biblical curiosities leads us to a unique question: What is the longest word in the Bible?</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-138 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3></h3><h3><strong>Unveiling the Lengthy Word</strong></h3><p>In the Book of Isaiah 8:1, a peculiar word steals the spotlight. “Moreover, the Lord said unto me, Take thee a great roll, and write in it with a man’s pen concerning Maher-shalal-hash-baz.” Maher-shalal-hash-baz, a mighty 18-character word, holds the title of the longest word in the Bible. It’s not just any word; it was the name given to one of the sons of the prophet Isaiah.</p><p>This lengthy name wasn’t chosen casually. The Lord used it to convey a prophecy, foretelling the destruction that awaited Israel and Syria at the hands of the Assyrians. Translated, Maher-shalal-hash-baz means “speed the spoil, hasten the plunder,” as per the insights shared by Art and the Bible.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3><strong>Exploring Other Lengthy Names and Words</strong></h3><p>Maher-shalal-hash-baz may be the longest, but there are other impressive contenders in the Bible. The second-longest name, Chushanrishathaim, comes close with just one character less. This figure was the king of the northwest Mesopotamian region, as mentioned in Judges 3:8-Another noteworthy name is Zaphnathpaaneah, boasting 15 characters and found in Genesis 41:4Interestingly, this was Joseph’s given name when he assumed the role of prime minister in Egypt, a tidbit shared by Adventist Record.</p><p>Beyond these, there’s a lineup of lengthy names exceeding 10 characters: Tilgathpilneser, Berodachbaladan, Nebuchadnezzar, and Mephibosheth. Each of these names carries its own historical weight.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3><strong>If Names Take a Back Seat</strong></h3><p>Let’s shift our focus from names to words. The Bible presents us with five words, each wielding 16 characters, that stand out in their length. These words, found in both the Old and New Testaments, are: lovingkindnesses, evilfavouredness, unprofitableness, convenantbreakers, and fellow-prisoners, according to Art and the Bible.</p><p>As we explore the vastness of the Bible, these lengthy words and names add a layer of richness to its tapestry. Each holds a piece of history, a story waiting to be discovered. So, whether you’re a seasoned Bible reader or just beginning your journey, there’s always something new and intriguing to uncover within its pages.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148 data-inserter-version=2></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r6%2FEq6upp5mjwW%2BvzqZma2hiaHxyfo6wn5qsXZ7AbsDHnmSlp56csrTAjLCmq5xdnrtuwMeeZJuhkqGyb7TTpqM%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
