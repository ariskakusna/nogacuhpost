The rule has been a large source of debate as of late thanks to Zion Williamson's freak injury that could have cost him his status as a first overall pick.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Brown was drafted with the first overall pick in 2001 and came into the league straight out of high school.

He says his life post-NBA has been more than enough.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Factor out the numbers, I know economics," Brown explained.
