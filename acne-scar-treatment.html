After all, acne scars and dark spots are two side-effects of the skin condition that can feel just as tricky, and annoying, to navigate as acne itself.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But while they're often used interchangeably, acne scars and dark spots are actually two different beasts that require their own plan of attack. While getting rid of acne scars completely is not possible (sadly, they are permanent), there are ways to reduce their appearance. Ahead, dermatologists explain how to determine if you have acne scars or dark spots, the best in-office and over-the-counter acne treatment options to minimize them — and how to avoid them in the first place.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-are-acne-scars-and-dark-spots--and-how-are-they-different></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Are Acne Scars and Dark Spots — and How Are They Different?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For starters, let's define an acne scar. You'll know you have one if you notice permanent indentations or raised bumps in the skin, says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Joshua Zeichner</a>, MD, the director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Zeichner says there are four main types of acne scars: hypertrophic scars, which are thick, raised bumps; rolling scars, characterized by undulations or divots in the skin; boxcar scars, or craters in the skin with sharp borders; and ice pick scars, deep but narrow scars that "look like the skin was stabbed with an ice pick" (sorry for that visual).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Dark spots</a> on the other hand — which are commonly and confusingly referred to as "acne scars" — are not permanent and don't cause skin thickening, which is indicative of scarring, Dr. Zeichner explains.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dark spots are the result of post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) which occurs when melanocytes (pigment-producing skin cells) "respond to trauma or inflammation by producing pigment that causes the injured area to turn dark," explains Tina S. Alster, MD, director of the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Washington Institute of Dermatologic Laser Surgery</a>.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-causes-acne-scars></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Causes Acne Scars?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Acne scars are caused by abnormal collagen production that occurs when the skin is healing itself from a pimple — and unfortunately, they can happen whether you picked at your skin or not, Dr. Zeichner explains.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">That's because how acne heals has a lot do with genetics. "We don't understand why, but some people have a more robust healing response than other people," he says. "In some cases, severe acne may heal with almost no marks on the skin; in other cases, even mild acne may leave significant scars."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">That's not to say you shouldn't still follow your derm's advice and quit your pimple-picking habit since it can add to your risk of scarring, both derms say. Plus, the bacteria that's on your hands or under your nails increase your risk for more breakouts.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-is-the-best-acne-scar-treatment></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Is the Best Acne Scar Treatment?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While the bad news is that true acne scars are permanent, there are a few dermatologic treatments that can provide significant improvement in their appearance, Dr. Zeichner says.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Laser Treatments</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Zeichner says laser treatments, like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Fraxel</a>, "work by punching microscopic holes in the skin, creating a controlled wound and allowing the skin to heal itself up in a more cosmetically acceptable manner. The laser treatment is also commonly used to treat sunspots.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Microneedling</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Microneedling</a> is another more recent option for treating acne scars. Like lasers, microneedling creates controlled damage to the skin and "allows new collagen to replace the abnormal scar-forming collagen," Dr. Zeichner says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for cost, he says you can expect laser or microneedling treatments to range between $750 and $1500 per session, depending on the surface area of skin being treated and the professional who performs the service. "Oftentimes, multiple treatments may be needed for optimal results, spaced every four to six weeks," he says, adding that patients can expect about a week of downtime.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Chemical Peel</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Depending on the severity of your acne, a chemical peel could be helpful in reducing the appearance of scars. The <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>American Society for Dermatologic Surgery</a> says that the purpose of a chemical peel is to peel away older skin from the surface and replace it with newer, smoother skin that helps to fill in existing scars. Solutions in chemical peels include a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>variety of acids</a>, such as glycolic, trichloroacetic, salicylic acid, and lactic acid, and while it may be best to get a chemical peel done professionally, there are at-home peels that have been thoroughly tested to achieve similar results.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-do-otc-acne-scar-treatments-work></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Do OTC Acne Scar Treatments Work?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Because the first step to preventing acne scars is avoiding them in the first place, Dr. Zeichner says there are a few over-the-counter treatments you may want to keep on hand for a pimple that just won't quit.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Salicylic Acid</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">An over-the-counter salicylic acid cleanser is a good place to start to keep skin clear, according to Dr. Zeichner. He recommends <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Kamedis Acne Cleanser</a> ($14) which, in addition to salicylic acid, contains soothing botanical ingredients to calm inflammation in the skin.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Beta Hydroxy Acid and Retinol</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Products with beta hydroxy acid — which removes excess oil and exfoliates dead skin cells — are also a solid pick to help keep skin clear, as well as topical retinoids, like <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Serum</a> ($17), Dr. Zeichner says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you have existing scars already, retinoids may offer another benefit. "Acne scars tend to look worse with age as the skin loses its structure," he says. "Retinol can help stimulate collagen to strengthen and better support the skin."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Sunscreen</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Another crucial tool for existing acne scars: <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Sunscreen</a>. It's the best way to prevent scar worsening (or color darkening), Dr. Alster says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The bottom line with over-the-counter products is that, while you will find a few options to help prevent acne (and, therefore, potential scarring) and even fade dark spots, topical treatments for treating true acne scars will likely require a visit to the derm.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_55-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Early, effective treatment is your best option," Dr. Zeichner says. "If over-the-counter treatments are not working, visit a board-certified dermatologist for a prescription regimen." He recommends asking about <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Epiduo Forte Gel</a>, a treatment that has been proven effective at treating acne and helping to reduce the risk of depressed acne scars.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK570qSgp2eRmLumedKcmKtlpKeyosDMnqWt</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
