Several of our favourite rap divas stepped out for the special occasion, <a href=# rel>including Ice Spice</a> and Yung Miami, as well as <a href=# class=text-word rel>Cardi B</a>. <a href=# class=text-word rel>Rihanna</a> was at the function too, arriving <a href=# rel>fashionably late</a>, as she and A$AP Rocky have previously become known to do. Anna Wintour's theme of choice was a tribute to her late friend Karl Lagerfeld, and while Minaj wasn't at the Met last night, she did share some of her fond memories with the fallen fashion icon on Instagram.</p><p>"I set trends from Queens to Beijing ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³," the mother of one wrote in the caption of her photo dump, which begins with a throwback photo from an ELLE Magazine photoshoot with Lagerfeld. "Iâ€™m not the one who do the imitating," Minaj added before revealing that she's got a music video dropping on Tuesday (May 2) for "Alone" at 4 PM ET. Her other carousel selections chiefly include more snapshots with the Chanel designer, proving that they forged a <a href=# rel>heartwarming friendship</a> in the later years of his life.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-nicki-minaj-pays-tribute-to-the-late-karl-lagerfeld>Nicki Minaj Pays Tribute to the Late Karl Lagerfeld</h2></span><p>Minaj also made sure to remind followers of some of her past iconic outfits, proving that she's always been a <a href=# rel>style star</a> â€“ Met Gala invite or not. While some of them found her leaning into her masculine side in a unique tuxedo, others flaunted her <a href=# rel>famous (ass)ets</a> as she sultrily gazes back at the camera. She's not often one to keep up with what everyone else is wearing, instead choosing to influence the world with her unique choices.</p><p>It remains unclear if the Trinidadian simply opted to skip out on showing up (as many celebrities, including BeyoncÃ©, seemingly did), or if she was one of the names cut from Wintour's <a href=# rel>uber-exclusive guest list</a>. Regardless, she's sure to continue serving us plenty of fire looks on her social media as the weather continues to heat up. Scroll further to see Nicki Minaj's iconic outfits from past Met Galas.
