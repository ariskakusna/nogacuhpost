The cocaine use leading up to his arrest was another significant reason as to why Crosby, Stills, Nash, & Young broke up. Crosby's imprisonment was the nail in the coffin. He cited it as what "pretty much destroyed" the band (via <a href=#>Guitar.com</a>).</p><p>Crosby served five months in prison and stated that he was no longer taking drugs upon his release in 1986 (via <a href=#>L.A. Times</a>). Despite the fact that his time in prison was key to helping him kick his drug addiction, this was not Crosby's last run-in with the law. In 2004,&nbsp;<a href=#>The New York Times</a>&nbsp;reported that he was arrested for drugs and weapons again,&nbsp;this time with marijuana, a loaded pistol, and two knives all found in his bag at a New York City hotel.</p><p>After two arrests and a reputation spanning six decades, David Crosby now lives a simpler life and as shown by his 2019 documentary <a href=#>"David Crosby: Remember My Name,"</a> he wishes to reconcile with his former bandmates. However, at the time of the documentary's production, none of them have spoken to him.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCDl21pbmxfnby4ecyapbJlpJ66pr%2BMoZisZZSWw6qwjJypqKuSrnqjscSnZJqqoprAtbHDaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
