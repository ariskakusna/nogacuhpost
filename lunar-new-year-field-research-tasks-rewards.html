Players are constantly given events to give themselves something to do in Pokemon GO. With the <a href=#>Twinkling Fantasy</a> event coming to a close, it is time for Pokemon GO players to look forward to the latest event from Niantic.</p><p>Next up is the <strong>Lunar New Year event </strong>coming to Pokemon GO. With a new event that means that new <a href=#>Field Research Tasks</a> are going to become available for you to do as well. Here, we are going to go over what the Field Research tasks are for the Lunar New Year event and what kind of rewards you should expect for completing these tasks.</p><h2><strong>All Pokemon GO Lunar New Year Field Research Tasks And Rewards</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ginx.tv/imgcdn/EBsbzOh4E46Oljp2csP1J-DxXf9xhNKmdXjY2_PCxFs/rs:fill:0:0:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2lueC50di91cGxvYWRzMi9wb2tlbW9uX2dvX2x1bmFyX2ZpZWxkL3Bva2Vtb25fZ29fbHVuYXJfZmllbGRfMy5qcGc><p>When <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Niantic announces a new event</a>, they give us some insight into what to expect during that event. By taking a look at the featured Pokemon for the Lunar New Year event, we can figure out what to expect for the Field Research Tasks. The featured Pokemon in the Lunar New Year event feature both <strong>Fire-type Pokemon and Bunny Pokemon</strong>. As it is the Year of the Rabbit, it makes sense that there will be an abundance of rabbit Pokemon in Pokemon GO.</p><p>If you want more rabbit Pokemon or Fire-type Pokemon, you should definitely <strong>complete the Field Research Tasks</strong>. Here are the the field research tasks as well as the rewards you can get from them for the Lunar New Year event in Pokemon GO:</p><p><strong>Pokemon GO Field Research Tasks And Rewards For the Lunar New Year Event</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Catch 25 Pokemon </strong>- Darumaka or Galarian Darumaka Encounter</li><li><strong>Send 3 Gifts And Add a Sticker to Each</strong> - Bunearyor BunnelbyEncounter</li><li><strong>Trade a Pokemon</strong> - Paras or Combee Encounter</li><li><strong>Open 3 Gifts</strong> - Charmander, Cyndaquil, Torchic, Chimchar, Tepic, Fennekin, or Litten Encounter</li></ul><p>As you can see, there is plenty of opportunity to get yourself a <strong>Fire-type starter Pokemon</strong> that you might have missed. On top of that, a majority of the Pokemon that you are rewarded with through the Field Research Tasks have a chance to be shiny Pokemon. These tasks are pretty simple, so it is well worth your time to complete them.</p><h3><strong>When Does The Lunar New Year Event In Pokemon GO Start?</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ginx.tv/imgcdn/tm4RZ4JcqGZIjTvpTOpFG3bkp739bENXFOaYbh1RxWY/rs:fill:0:0:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2lueC50di91cGxvYWRzMi9wb2tlbW9uX2dvX2x1bmFyX2ZpZWxkL3Bva2Vtb25fZ29fbHVuYXJfZmllbGRfMi5qcGc><p>When it comes to Field Research Tasks for events, you only have the duration of the event to actually complete each task. Outside of that, you will miss out on your chance to get yourself some exclusive rewards, which include getting a <strong>shiny Pokemon</strong>.</p><p>With that being said, the Lunar New Year event starts on <strong>January 19th and until January 23rd</strong>. Once January 24th arrives, you will no longer be able to take on the Field Research Tasks and will miss out on the rewards.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ginx.tv/imgcdn/2qTcliBkdQ2tt-IwTfnfNqnLcqX9oyo7hz8UfmwTOtk/rs:fill:180:180:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2lueC50di91cGxvYWRzMi8xX1N0YWZmX1Bob3Rvcy9kYW5pZWxfYm9yamFzLmpwZw alt="Daniel Borjas" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXNsWWtrl%2Bau3C8zqScpqeeYrSwe8uupZqqXaOyuHnYnpirZZaesq2wjKucrJ2Rp7CpedOaqqSrXaeyuK3Rnao%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
