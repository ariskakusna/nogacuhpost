Prince and local officials. Moreover, White alleged that police refused to provide security to his tour due to his beef with Prince of Rap-A-Lot and Mob Ties. Apparently, authorities believed the show would put Charleston and the audience in danger. Furthermore, the former gang leader spoke on Prince's <a href=# rel>power and connections</a> in the Houston music scene that he believes led to his show's drop last night (February 17).</p><p>HOUSTON - FEBRUARY 19: Rap-A-Lot Records CEO J.

"The Mayor and the Houston Police Department say that they are getting calls that Charleston White is gonna be speaking at an event. Houston Police Department sounds like a bunch of p***ies to me. I see why Rap-A-Lot runs that s**t. No wonder they Mob Ties. No wonder everybody got to check in y’all. Now I’m checking in with the police department. The police department told me, ‘Hey, man, you got a problem with Mr. James Prince. We don’t want no problems. The mayor’s office called and say, ‘Hey, Mr. Charleston, we hear you got a problem with James Prince. Man, we scared of him.’ I swear to God, y'all. I just got the call from the Houston Mayor’s office and the gang unit Police Department in Houston, Texas. They are scardified of Rap-A-Lot.”</p><span><h3 id=h-charleston-white-sends-further-threats-to-j-prince>Charleston White Sends Further Threats To J Prince</h3></span><p>Furthermore, he continued by <a href=# rel>grabbing various of his guns</a> and claiming that they don't run things in Dallas, denying intimidation. “This what I’ll say to the Houston Police Department. Y’all can suck my d**k too. F**k Houston. N***a, f**k Houston, Texas. I’m spending my own goddamn money to come down here to talk to you poor ass dumb a** motherf***ing Houstonians. F**k Houston. F**k Harris, PD. C***sucking pigs. <a href=# rel>Y'all some motherf***ing cowards.</a></p><p>"Man, let me get my goddamn guns and go to the goddamn gun range," he continued. "This is what I got for Rap-A-Lot Records. I got a whole bunch of goddamn motherf***ing guns for Rap-A-Lot. Man, Houston police y’all some p***ies.” Also, he called the Mayor of Houston Sylvester Turner a homophobic slur. However you feel about this allegation, check back in with HNHH for the latest on J.
