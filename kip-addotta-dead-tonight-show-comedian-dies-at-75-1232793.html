Thank you to all of his friends and fans who have supported him throughout his life and career. His wit will be missed but his writings will live forever,” Addotta’s family wrote in their post.&nbsp;</p><p>Along with entertaining Johnny Carson’s audiences, Addotta’s credits included appearances on The Midnight Special and American Bandstand, as well as hosting Playboy Channel’s Everything Goes. He also appeared on radio’s The Dr. Demento Show for his songs “Life in the Slaw Lane” and “Wet Dream.”</p><p>Drew Carey paid tribute to Addotta on <a href=# rel=nofollow>Twitter</a>, writing, “A major influence on my stand-up. He gave me so much advice about the mechanics and art of comedy. And also from just watching him onstage. Bless you, brother. And thanks.”</p><p>Addotta participated in Carey’s N.Y. Friars Club Roast in 1998.&nbsp;</p><p>Born in Rockford, Illinois, in 1944, the comic appeared in several films, including<i> Bound for Glory</i>&nbsp;(1976) and&nbsp;<i>For da Love of Money </i>(2002). Addotta later detailed his career in an autobiography published in 2018 titled&nbsp;<i>Confessions of a Comedian.</i></p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOpKCpZZGZsbDA05pknZ2RmXq1u82inqGsXai1sMOMnKamnZSerq95w6KcrGWRqXp4gYxqaWxqZ26AcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
