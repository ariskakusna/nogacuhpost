The Asheville, North Carolina native, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Jermaine Dupri</a>, is back with a new special guest. He is more known for his work behind the scenes when it comes to crafting songs, but Dupri still has his own solo catalog. However, it has remained dormant since the year 2001. Before this year, he only had two albums released on streaming.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Firstly, Life In 1472 (The Original Soundtrack) churned out some classics such as "Money Ain't a Thang," <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">which featured Jay-Z</a>. Then, fans would have to wait around two years for his next effort, Instructions. That boasted "Welcome To Atlanta" with <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Ludacris</a>. That would be the last we would hear from Dupri on the solo side of things, though. That is, until 22 long years passed by. <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">For Motivational Use Only, Vol. 1 </a>was put out back in April and it was a collab album with <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Curren$y</a>.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-listen-to-pick-it-up-from-jermaine-dupri-and-jacquees>Listen To "Pick It Up" From Jermaine Dupri And Jacquees</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Now, we are hearing more material already from the legendary songwriter. He teams up with Jacquees for the first time on "Pick it Up." It is a fun and lovey type of track that features Dupri's production and a verse too. The beat is bouncy ear candy and it makes for a fun listen. Jacquees is singing his heart out on this cut and hopefully they can make more tracks because this is a vibe.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">What are your initial thoughts on this brand new single, "Pick it Up," from Jermaine Dupri and Jacquees?
