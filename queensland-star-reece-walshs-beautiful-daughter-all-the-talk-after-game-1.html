She’s the reason why I go out there and put on this jersey.”</p><p>“I got my jersey,” Leila added as hearts melted across the country.</p><p>There was plenty of talk leading up to the match that the Blues were planning to target the Queensland debutant.</p><p>While admitting he was “full of nerves” leading up to kick-off, Walsh handled the occasion beautifully.</p><p>“Just doing my job mate,” he said.</p><p>“Everyone’s going to question myself, but Billy’s a good coach and he had the trust in me and I was confident throughout the week.</p><p>“All I had to do was my job.”</p><p>Walsh was trending on social media after the match, with one fan commenting he “looked like he’s played in 10 Origins”.</p><p>He also earned a shout-out from Blues great Garry Jack, who tweeted his fellow fullback had a “fantastic game”.</p><p>Another youngster earning plaudits was 21-year-old Hamiso Tabuai-Fidow, who scored two tries including an electrifying effort that put Queensland in front for good in the 74th minute.</p><p>It was Tabuai-Fidow’s second Origin appearance and first since Game 1 back in 2021.</p><p>Coach Slater couldn’t have been prouder of the duo.</p><p>“They were super,” Slater said of Walsh and Tabuai-Fidow.</p><p>“It’s easy to sensationalise a stat to suit your narrative with the seven changes to our side, but Hamiso was fantastic.</p><p>“There was a big moment when we needed him and he delivered with that try.</p><p>“And Reece played really tough. He attacked the high ball and was there when Queensland needed him.</p><p>“I’m so proud of our effort.”</p><p>Walsh was also asked about Tabuai-Fidow, who was rewarded by Slater after his impressive season for the Dolphins after making the switch from the Cowboys.</p><h4 class=g_font-title-xxs>More Coverage</h4><p>“He’s a terrific player. Lots of questions about Hammer and I think he shut everyone up tonight,” Walsh said.</p><p>“He’s a quality player and I love playing alongside Hammer. Me and him played juniors together and when he’s in the clear, he’s very hard to stop.</p><p>“I’m proud of Hammer tonight.”</p><span class=title>Read related topics:</span><a class=topic_tag href=# data-tgev-container=story-topic-links data-tgev-label=Brisbane data-tgev-order=1 data-tgev-metric=npv data-tgev=event10>Brisbane</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ70qmmq6xfo7%2Bte9CunJ6mo6Gur7CMrKuaql2nsqavxGaumqSjncBursSarK2hlqq5brDArp6hrJWneqK4y2aroZ1dqa6tt4yana2domK0ornEZmhoppWswG6%2F06ipsmeWmIJ3gpGbmGpqYml%2FdXzDnZptmpaXfaKBlZ1qnGlmmQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
