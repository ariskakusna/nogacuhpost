Dimeji Bankole</h2><p class=align-left>Although, he was not really visible in the weeks leading to the exercise, Bankole, a former Speaker of the House of Representatives, seems to have gone into hibernation after stepping down for Tinubu during the primary election. He was recently named in the <a href=#>APC</a> presidential campaign council list and one would expect he will become visible soon.</p><h2>2. Tein Jack-Rich</h2><p class=align-left>Jack-Rich, 48, is an oil magnate who hails from Rivers state in the south-south region of the country. He is a multidimensional strategic thinker, a motivator, and a strong believer in the greater Nigeria and this was very obvious to public watchers when he contested for the APC ticket. However, after he lost, he has gone quiet.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/b4b50e23eb454226.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>PDP crisis: New twist as Wike, Makinde, Ortom make bold moves against Atiku, Ayu</span></p></a><h2>3. Ibikunle Amosun</h2><p class=align-left>Like Bankole, the former governor of Ogun state and serving senator stepped down for Tinubu. But, Amosun has since then stayed away from the public glare. Although, part of the reason is that the Senate has been on recess, but political observers say Amosun is not the type of politician that stays in the background for too long.</p><h2>4. Rochas Okorocha</h2><p class=align-left>A serving senator and former governor of Imo state, Okorocha delivered a very powerful speech at the convention. Unfortunately, it seems the minds of the delegates were already made up. His last major public appearance was when Tinubu visited him and also recently when he celebrated his birthday. He has been somewhat quiet given his political stature as a giant in national politics.</p><h2>5. Tunde Bakare</h2><p class=align-left>Bakare, 67, is a pastor and Serving Overseer of Global Citadel Community Church. He was the vice-presidential candidate and running mate of President Muhammadu Buhari in the 2011 presidential elections under the defunct Congress for Political Change. His speech at the election would be reference for political historians. He has returned to missionary work since then.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/9063b16dd4e360ef.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>"Give him food and he'll sing your praise", ex-Buhari minister lambast Fani-Kayode</span></p></a><h2>6. Emeka Nwajiuba</h2><p class=align-left>Nwajiuba, 54, is the immediate past minister of state for education, a position he held until he resigned after declaring to contest for presidency. He has been quiet but he is in court challenging the emergence of Tinubu as the APC presidential candidate and interestingly, he is also challenging the emergence of Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party.</p><h2>7. Ajayi Boroffice</h2><p class=align-left>Boroffice, 73, is the lawmaker representing <a href=#>Ondo</a> North senatorial district in the upper chamber of the National Assembly since 2011. He was one of those who stepped down for Tinubu during the election. For a politician of his stature, he has been really quiet after that day. He is, however, expected to play key roles in the presidential campaign of the APC.</p><h3>8. Ken Nnamani</h3><p class=align-left>Nnamani, 73, is an APC chieftain who served as the Senate president from 2005 to 2007. Before joining the APC, he was a member of the PDP representing <a href=#>Enugu</a> East senatorial district and served until 2007. For someone so vocal about the APC's relevance to the southeast before the election, Nnamani has gone quiet after the primary election.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/e1c454d8e6a5bb1c.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Nigeria's ruling party fends off questions over candidate</span></p></a><h2>9. Ogbonnaya Onu</h2><p class=align-left>He was the first civilian governor of Abia state between January 1992 and November 1993. Onu was also the minister of science, technology, and innovation under President Buhari before he resigned to contest for the APC presidential ticket. His speech at the convention calling on delegates to ensure justice by voting the southeast fell on deaf ears. He has been quiet since then.</p><h2>10. Ikeobasi Mokelu</h2><p class=align-left>He is a former minister of information under the military regime of late General Sani Abacha. He was the last presidential aspirant to pick the nomination and expression of interest forms of the ruling party. His speech at the convention was focused on praising President Buhari instead of convincing the delegates. He was quiet before the election, he has gone back to the status quo.</p><h2>11. Sani Yerima</h2><p class=align-left>Yerima, 61, was a two-term governor of Zamfara state who held office from May 1999 to May 2007. Thereafter, he served as the senator representing Zamfara West from 2007 to 2019. He is only visible when he is contesting for presidency which is fast becoming his favourite past time. He has gone back to hibernation after his failed ambition.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/a2a34f1c02fa3020.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>BREAKING: "I am not dead", Bola Tinubu emerges in new video</span></p></a><h2>APC to expand presidential campaign council list to accommodate aggrieved chieftains</h2><p class=align-left>In a related development, Tinubu is said to have concluded plans to include an additional 2,000 members in the newly constituted presidential campaign council of the APC.</p><p class=align-left>The move was aimed at pacifying APC National Working Committee members and state governors who were dissatisfied with the 422-member campaign council.</p><p class=align-left>The list of members released by the secretary of the Presidential Campaign Council, James Faleke, in Abuja, was said to have<a href=#> angered many of the party's chieftains.</a></p><h2>2023: Demand for bullet-proof vehicles surge ahead of general elections</h2><p class=align-left>Meanwhile, as preparations for the 2023 general elections gain momentum, the d<a href=#>emands for bullet-proof Sports Utility Vehicles have increased</a> significantly across the country.</p><p class=align-left>Very Important Personalities, top chieftains and candidates of political parties have been procuring customised vehicles that offer special protection in the run-up to the campaigns and elections.</p><p class=align-left>Apart from ordering armoured vehicles, it was also learnt that politicians were applying for special police protection and procuring other security wares.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkvbC4yK2gnKtfZoF6gZVwbGZpYWKusa%2BMqameq5mZsq%2FAyJqjZpmjpbazrc2tqmappZ6ytXnPmqmtsaNivbOx0qKbnqaknq6tec%2BroKaZop6ytHs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
