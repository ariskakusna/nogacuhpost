To hide her shame, Hera agreed to marry him. It was a violent marriage at best. Though Zeus had pursued his sister and sought to possess her by marriage, he never gave up his lusty ways.<h2>Who was the ugliest god?</h2>Hephaestus. Hephaestus is the son of Zeus and Hera.

Dionysus can now claim that both his father and his “mother” are gods.<h2>Who is Zeus's second wife?</h2>By swallowing Metis, however, Zeus had gained wisdom as part of his intrinsic nature.
