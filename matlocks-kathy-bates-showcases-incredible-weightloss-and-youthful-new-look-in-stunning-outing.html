Confronted with Type Two Diabetes, a condition prevalent in her family, she made a decisive change to her lifestyle.&nbsp;</p><p id=ep0xH37H4hu data-wc=42>"I was facing diabetes — it runs in my family — and I really didn’t want to live with that," she revealed to Extra. Determined to avoid the health challenges associated with the disease, Kathy adopted a new mindset towards her well-being.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/461c62c2f71c-gettyimages-140992481.jpg><p id=eiOoaFGsF42 data-wc=37>"[I'm] in the best health I’ve been in years and I’m so grateful — it’s a miracle," Kathy expressed, her gratitude evident. She attributed her weight loss success to mindful eating, describing a simple yet effective technique.&nbsp;</p><p id=eZp4LlH08fS data-wc=55>"After you eat for 20-30 minutes, you experience an involuntary sigh. It’s communication between stomach and brain telling you you had enough… and what I discovered is if you listen to that sigh and push that plate away for just five minutes, you realize you’re satisfied and you don’t have to eat more," she explained.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/9dd689e8b41f-gettyimages-2161353933.jpg><p id=eHicGEpfDbU data-wc=21>Kathy's health journey also includes managing lymphedema, a condition that causes swelling in limbs due to excess fluid from inflamed tissue.&nbsp;</p><p id=eVrRZatGStU data-wc=44>This common post-cancer side effect has been part of her life since battling cancer twice. First diagnosed with stage one ovarian cancer in 2003, she fought the disease with chemotherapy. In 2012, doctors found a tumor in her left breast, leading to a mastectomy.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/9807669b7a27-gettyimages-2150637523.jpg><p id=eHBh21RKpRl data-wc=46>Despite these challenges, Kathy's weight loss has significantly alleviated her lymphedema symptoms. "I’ve lost a lot of weight and it’s really helped with my symptoms. I just still have to wear compression sleeves or guard against bug bites because that can lead to sepsis," she added..</p><p id=eBN63RX_rEL data-wc=19>Kathy’s role in the Matlock reboot marks a significant achievement, especially in an industry where ageism remains a challenge.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/58dbb1e5b7ed-gettyimages-141034181.jpg><p id=e65Bfz5bjPQ data-wc=46>&nbsp;"A woman my age would never have such a role, ever," said Kathy, who also played a lawyer in NBC's short-lived "Harry's Law." "The complexity; the writing.
