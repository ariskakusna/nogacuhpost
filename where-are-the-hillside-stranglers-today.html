Buono died alone in his cell at California State Prison with no signs of trauma, and a heart ailment is suspected to be the cause of his death. He had been serving a life sentence after the jury decided not to recommend the death penalty. His death was celebrated by the prosecutor and judge that presided over his trial.</p><p>According to <a href=#>Biography</a>, Kenneth Bianchi is currently serving six life sentences, having avoided the death penalty by testifying against his cousin. In 1989, Bianchi married a pen pal from Louisiana in a prison chapel ceremony, and in 2010, his latest request for parole was denied. At the age of 70, Bianchi has been imprisoned for about four decades, and it doesn't look likely that he'll leave any time soon.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCDj3FncW1frLWmvsRmmKudXam1pnnHoqOlq5mZsm6%2F06uYp5%2Bcmr%2B0edOom5qxXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
