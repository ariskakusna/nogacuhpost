But if you're the best player in baseball, you need a lot of sleep.</p><p>During Tuesday night's <strong>MLB All-Star Game</strong> in <strong>Seattle</strong>, <strong>Shohei Ohtani</strong> admitted the biggest key to his success was a special sleep regimen -- one which has been known to take up half of a 24-hour day.</p><h2 class=ue-c-article__subheadline>The details of Ohtani's routine</h2><p>During his time in <strong>Nippon Professional Baseball</strong>, <strong>Ohtani</strong> struck up a sponsorship deal with national bedding giant <strong>Nishikawa</strong> -- a relationship that has been maintained and nurtured since the two-way star joined the <strong>Los Angeles Angels</strong> in 2018.</p><p><a href=#>Ohtani</a> considers sleep as his "recovery" -- and the term is an apt one, given the workload he shoulders for the <strong>Angels</strong> on a regular basis. Ohtani considers sleep as an essential part of his training, especially during the grueling <a href=# rel=nofollow>162-game</a><strong>MLB</strong> season.</p><p>And thanks to his partnership with Nishikawa, <a href=#>Ohtani</a> has access to a wide range of innovative products that further encourage deep sleep. One such product is a <a href=# rel=nofollow>portable mattress</a> he first used during the <strong>World Baseball Classic</strong>.</p><h2 class=ue-c-article__subheadline>The emergence of sleep science</h2><p><strong>Ohtani</strong> is a prime example of how beneficial regular, lengthy sleep can be relative to peak athletic performance.</p><p>Several <strong>NFL</strong> teams began seriously <a href=# rel=nofollow>embracing</a> sleep science in the mid-2010s. The emerging field was also credited with helping <strong>Premier League</strong> side <strong>Leicester City</strong> overcome 5000-to-1 odds to win the title in 2016 -- and now it's been revealed that consistent, prolonged sleep is critical for Ohtani's amazing achievements as a hitter and a pitcher.</p><p>As usual, Ohtani will be one of the top players to watch now that the <strong>All-Star Game</strong> is finished. The 29-year-old could be playing out his final months with the <strong>Angels</strong>, with <strong>Los Angeles</strong> set to miss the postseason again as the two-way phenomenon's contract expires this fall.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RnJhnm5%2BifKa6jqajm2ecpMBurc2gnKWdo2Kur7PEpapoamBngHB8lmhoa2dmaa6mfcOdam1uYWuAp3yUbG5xmmRqhKN6x62kpQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
