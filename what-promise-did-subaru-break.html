Subaru has been cursed and he now “returns by death.” Realizing that he can't do anything about it on his own, he turns to Beatrice for help. She explains that in order to lift the curse, he'll need to “kiss” someone.<h2>Who does Subaru Natsuki end up with?</h2>It's Emilia that he first falls in love with and her that he's dedicated his life towards helping. However, as the show went on and his relationship with Rem deepened, the choice became less obvious. One of the most memorable moments of season one is the episode 'From Zero'.<h2>Who married Emilia in Re:Zero?</h2>After Fortuna's death, Regulus kept the 79th seat vacant for someone special.

Distraught by memories of Rem being wiped from everyone's minds, Subaru tells Emilia about Return By Death.<h2>Can Reinhard beat Puck?</h2>Reinhard with most of his Divine Protections disabled is still strong enough to defeat Cecilus Segmunt and kill both Puck and Halibel while being gravely wounded from his fight with the aforementioned Blue Lightning.<h2>Why can't Subaru say return by Death?</h2>Unlike most abilities, Return by Death isn't a power that Subaru has complete control over. Rather than use it on a whim, Subaru must instead go with the flow and work with what he's given. The power activates once Subaru dies, sending him back to a predetermined point in time with his memories intact.<h2>Why do Subarus smell witches?</h2>Despite being unaware of it before, Subaru was brought to this world by Satella, i.e., the Witch of envy, and was bestowed with a rare ability. Additionally, he was constantly in contact with her through the ability “Return by Death.” Subaru was always associated with the Witch and thus had her scent on him.<h2>Is Roswaal an enemy?</h2>Roswaal explaining his reason for living.

Roswaal wants to revive his teacher, Echidna, with the help of the dragon's blood. He is not evil, as he is simply doing everything to fulfill his goal. While we have cleared that part, what about the witch he seems to revere?<h2>Is Roswaal immortal?</h2>The spell was originally created by Echidna to gain immortality, but she could not complete it before her demise. Instead, it was finished by Roswaal who had been using it to survive until the present era.<h2>Does Beatrice remember Subaru?</h2>In episode 5 of the anime Subaru experiences the first Return by Death at Roswaal's mansion: after he runs away from his bedroom, he meets Beatrice, who remembers him even if that should be the first time they meet in that "loop".<h2>Why did Subaru tell Echidna?</h2>In arc 4 of the light novel, after the other witches advised Subaru to be cautious of Echidna and her contract, the latter was forced to reveal her true intentions. Echidna helped Subaru to access his 'Return by Death' ability as he was the only person who could satisfy her 'Greed. ' READ: Why Can't Subaru Die?<h2>Is the Witch of Envy Emilia?</h2>1. Is Emilia the Witch of Envy? Emilia is not the Witch of Envy as she was just a child when they sealed her. Furthermore, when Subaru told Emilia about 'Return by Death,' she died, which would not make sense if she was the Witch of Envy.<h2>Is Echidna in love with Subaru?</h2>The author has implied and outright stated that Echidna holds some degree of genuine affection/feelings toward Subaru even after he declined her contract.<h2>Is Echidna a villain Re:Zero?</h2>Echidna, also known as the Witch of Greed, Echidna of Greed and later primarily as Omega, is a major anti-villain in the 2014 Japanese dark fantasy light novel series Re:Zero − Starting Life in Another World, as well as its 2016 anime television series & 2014 manga adaptations of the same name.<h2>Who is the strongest Witch in Re:Zero?</h2>Sekhmet is the most powerful Witch of Sin, excluding Satella.
