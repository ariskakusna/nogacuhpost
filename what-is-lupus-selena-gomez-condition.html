Lupus causes the immune system to produce too many antibodies, which may attack healthy tissues and leads to inflammation in the body. The symptoms can range from mild to life-threatening.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/20a52ea1e705-woman-with-headache-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=edijQeVNRC6g data-wc=8><strong>Lupus can cause joint pain, fatigue and headaches</strong></p><h3><strong>What causes Lupus?</strong></h3><p id=eemvjO5b5VY1 data-wc=50>Lupus is an autoimmune condition, which means it is caused by problems with the immune system.

The main symptoms include fatigue, joint pain and swelling, and rashes â€“ particularly on the face, wrist and hands.</p><p id=eQNotmFTZvMn data-wc=47>Other symptoms may include a fever, swollen lymph glands, high blood pressure, headaches and migraines, depression, chest pain and memory loss, among others.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen, may help to reduce inflammation and ease joint and muscle pain.

In more severe cases, sufferers may be prescribed Corticosteroids, which can bring symptoms under control and reduce inflammation quickly.</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
