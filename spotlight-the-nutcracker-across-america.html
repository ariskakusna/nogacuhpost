At NYCB, only children over the age of 12 will dance this year, though unvaccinated audience members under 12 will be allowed to attend with proof of a negative PCR test (all patrons will be required to wear a mask). PNB has integrated masks into the costumes of its young performers to keep them and the adults in the company safe. All audience members will be required to mask but only attendees 12 years and older must provide proof of vaccination or a negative test. MCB, for its part, appears at multiple venues throughout the season, adjusting protocols to the guidelines at each.</p><p><strong>Nutcrackers of all shapes and sizes</strong></p><p>In the 67 years since Balanchine’s "Nutcracker" premiered in New York City, nearly every community across the country has produced a version of the tale, often giving it their own unique spin. Chicago’s Joffrey Ballet presents a “Nutcracker” inspired by the city’s 1893 World’s Fair. In Costa Mesa, Calif., American Ballet Theater's touring "Nutcracker" features choreography by former Bolshoi Ballet Director Alexei Ratmanksy. Even Balanchine’s classic is seeing updates this year: Pacific Northwest Ballet has introduced a new character, Green Tea Cricket, to replace stereotypes of Chinese culture that were once part of the second act. Other companies, including NYCB, Boston Ballet and Tulsa Ballet have made similar changes.</p><p>From Texas Ballet Theater’s parody "The Nutty Nutcracker" in Fort Worth, Texas (appropriate for ages 13 and up) to Baton Rouge Ballet Theatre’s presentation of "The Nutcracker — A Tale from the Bayou," "The Nutcracker" takes many different forms this holiday season.</p><p>What if you could step right into the world of Marie and her magical Christmas gift? Island Moving Company in Rhode Island presents an interactive experience through their site-specific performances of "A Newport Nutcracker at Rosecliff." The production, which invites audience members to move through the rooms of the 1902 mansion, went digital in 2020 with <a href=#>Through Her Eyes: A Newport Nutcracker Reimagined</a>, a 30-minute film co-produced by WSBE Rhode Island PBS. The innovative project was filmed at six historic properties of the Preservation Society of Newport County. This year, "A Newport Nutcracker at Rosecliff" returns to its romantic Rosecliff home and welcomes local audiences back for in-person performances for its 19th season.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sa7SZ6arn1%2BWv7W1wqWcrGejpby1uMign61lpJ2ybrrUrZqrmZOgsrN5wJypqKujYq6usdGimpo%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwiftBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
